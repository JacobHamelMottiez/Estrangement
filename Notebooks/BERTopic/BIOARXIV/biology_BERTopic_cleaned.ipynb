         "RNA regulators are emerging as powerful tools to engineer synthetic genetic networks or rewire existing ones. A potential strength of RNA networks is that they may be able to propagate signals on time scales that are set by the fast degradation rates of RNAs. However, a current bottleneck to verifying this potential is the slow design-build-test cycle of evaluating these networks in vivo. Here, we adapt an Escherichia coli-based cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system for rapidly prototyping RNA networks. We used this system to measure the response time of an RNA transcription cascade to be approximately five minutes per step of the cascade. We also show that this response time can be adjusted with temperature and regulator threshold tuning. Finally, we use TX-TL to prototype a new RNA network, an RNA single input module, and show that this network temporally stages the expression of two genes in vivo. (Figure Presented).",

         "Motivation: Restriction-site-associated genomic markers are a powerful tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the population level, but are limited in their utility at deeper phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically recovered across disparate taxa. While this limitation stems in part from mutations to restriction recognition sites that disrupt data generation, an additional source of data loss comes from the failure to identify homology during bioinformatic analyses. Clustering methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at assembling RADseq loci at the phylogenetic scale. Results: PyRAD is a pipeline to assemble de novo RADseq loci with the aim of optimizing coverage across phylogenetic datasets. It uses a wrapper around an alignment-clustering algorithm, which allows for indel variation within and between samples, as well as for incomplete overlap among reads (e.g. paired-end). Here I compare PyRAD with the program Stacks in their performance analyzing a simulated RADseq dataset that includes indel variation. Indels disrupt clustering of homologous loci in Stacks but not in PyRAD, such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate taxa. I show through reanalysis of an empirical RADseq dataset that indels are a common feature of such data, even at shallow phylogenetic scales. PyRAD uses parallel processing as well as an optional hierarchical clustering method, which allows it to rapidly assemble phylogenetic datasets with hundreds of sampled individuals. © The Author 2014.",

         "Background: During early development, neural circuits fire spontaneously, generating activity episodes with complex spatiotemporal patterns. Recordings of spontaneous activity have been made in many parts of the nervous system over the last 25 years, reporting developmental changes in activity patterns and the effects of various genetic perturbations. Results: We present a curated repository of multielectrode array recordings of spontaneous activity in developing mouse and ferret retina. The data have been annotated with minimal metadata and converted into HDF5. This paper describes the structure of the data, along with examples of reproducible research using these data files. We also demonstrate how these data can be analysed in the CARMEN workflow system. This article is written as a literate programming document; all programs and data described here are freely available.Conclusions: 1. We hope this repository will lead to novel analysis of spontaneous activity recorded in different laboratories. 2. We encourage published data to be added to the repository. 3. This repository serves as an example of how multielectrode array recordings can be stored for long-term reuse.",

         "Key biological properties such as high genetic diversity and high evolutionary rate enhance the potential of certain RNA viruses to adapt and emerge. Identifying viruses with these properties in their natural hosts could dramatically improve disease forecasting and surveillance. Recently, we discovered two novel members of the viral family Arteriviridae : simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV)-krc1 and SHFV-krc2, infecting a single wild red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Nearly nothing is known about the biological properties of SHFVs in nature, although the SHFV type strain, SHFV-LVR, has caused devastating outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in captive macaques. Here we detected SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 in 40% and 47% of 60 wild red colobus tested, respectively. We found viral loads in excess of 106-107 RNA copies per milliliter of blood plasma for each of these viruses. SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 also showed high genetic diversity at both the inter- and intra-host levels. Analyses of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide diversity across viral genomes revealed patterns suggestive of positive selection in SHFV open reading frames (ORF) 5 (SHFV-krc2 only) and 7 (SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2). Thus, these viruses share several important properties with some of the most rapidly evolving, emergent RNA viruses.",

         "The non-protein amino acid β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) can induce plant resistance to a broad spectrum of biotic and abiotic stresses. However, BABA-induced plant resistance to insects is less well-studied, especially its underlying mechanism. In this research, we applied BABA to wheat seedlings and tested its effects on Sitobion avenae (F.). When applied as a soil drench, BABA significantly reduced weights of S. avenae, whereas foliar spray and seed treatment had no such effects. BABA-mediated suppression of S. avenae growth was dose dependent and lasted at least for 7 days. The aminobutyric acid concentration in phloem sap of BABA-treated plants was higher and increased with BABA concentrations applied. Moreover, after 10 days of treatment, the aminobutyric acid content in BABA-treated plants was still higher than that in control treatment. Sitobion avenae could not discriminate artificial diet containing BABA from standard diet, indicating that BABA itself is not a deterrent to this aphid. Also S. avenae did not show preference for control plants or BABA-treated plants. Consistent with choice test results, S. avenae had similar feeding activities on control and BABA-treated plants, suggesting that BABA did not induce antifeedants in wheat seedlings. In addition, aminobutyric acid concentration in S. avenae feeding on BABA-treated plants was significantly higher than those feeding on control plants. Sitobion avenae growth rate was reduced on the artificial diet containing BABA, indicating that BABA had direct toxic effects on this aphid species. These results suggest that BABA application reduced S. avenae performance on wheat seedlings and the mechanism is possibly due to direct toxicity of high BABA contents in plant phloem. © 2014 Cao et al.",

         "Motivated by data-rich experiments in transcriptional regulation and sensory neuroscience, we consider the following general problem in statistical inference: when exposed to a high-dimensional signal S, a system of interest computes a representation R of that signal, which is then observed through a noisy measurement M. From a large number of signals and measurements, we wish to infer the \"filter\" that maps S to R. However, the standard method for solving such problems, likelihood-based inference, requires perfect a priori knowledge of the \"noise function\" mapping R to M. In practice such noise functions are usually known only approximately, if at all, and using an incorrect noise function will typically bias the inferred filter. Here we show that in the large data limit, this need for a precharacterized noise function can be circumvented by searching for filters that instead maximize the mutual information I[M;R] between observed measurements and predicted representations. Moreover, if the correct filter lies within the space of filters being explored, maximizing mutual information becomes equivalent to simultaneously maximizing every dependence measure that satisfies the data processing inequality. It is important to note that maximizing mutual information will typically leave a small number of directions in parameter space unconstrained. We term these directions diffeomorphic modes and present an equation that allows these modes to be derived systematically. The presence of diffeomorphic modes reflects a fundamental and nontrivial substructure within parameter space, one that is obscured by standard likelihood-based inference. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",

         "Apicomplexan parasites are thought to actively invade the host cell by gliding motility. This movement is powered by the parasite's own actomyosin system, and depends on the regulated polymerisation and depolymerisation of actin to generate the force for gliding and host cell penetration. Recent studies demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii can invade the host cell in the absence of several core components of the invasion machinery, such as the motor protein myosin A (MyoA), the microneme proteins MIC2 and AMA1 and actin, indicating the presence of alternative invasion mechanisms. Here the roles of MyoA, MLC1, GAP45 and Act1, core components of the gliding machinery, are re-dissected in detail. Although important roles of these components for gliding motility and host cell invasion are verified, mutant parasites remain invasive and do not show a block of gliding motility, suggesting that other mechanisms must be in place to enable the parasite to move and invade the host cell. A novel, hypothetical model for parasite gliding motility and invasion is presented based on osmotic forces generated in the cytosol of the parasite that are converted into motility. © 2014 Egarter et al.",

         "Conjugation is the primary mechanism of horizontal gene transfer that spreads antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Although conjugation normally occurs in surface-associated growth (e.g., biofilms), it has been traditionally studied in well-mixed liquid cultures lacking spatial structure, which is known to affect many evolutionary and ecological processes. Here we visualize spatial patterns of gene transfer mediated by F plasmid conjugation in a colony of Escherichia coli growing on solid agar, and we develop a quantitative understanding by spatial extension of traditional mass-action models. We found that spatial structure suppresses conjugation in surface-associated growth because strong genetic drift leads to spatial isolation of donor and recipient cells, restricting conjugation to rare boundaries between donor and recipient strains. These results suggest that ecological strategies, such as enforcement of spatial structure and enhancement of genetic drift, could complement molecular strategies in slowing the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. © 2014 Biophysical Society.",

         "Immigration can rescue local populations from extinction, helping to stabilize a metapopulation. Local population dynamics is important for determining the strength of this rescue effect, but the mechanistic link between local demographic parameters and the rescue effect at the metapopulation level has received very little attention by modellers. We develop an analytical framework that allows us to describe the emergence of the rescue effect from interacting local stochastic dynamics. We show this framework to be applicable to a wide range of spatial scales, providing a powerful and convenient alternative to individual-based models for making predictions concerning the fate of metapopulations. We show that the rescue effect plays an important role in minimizing the increase in local extinction probability associated with high demographic stochasticity, but its role is more limited in the case of high local environmental stochasticity of recruitment or survival. While most models postulate the rescue effect, our framework provides an explicit mechanistic link between local dynamics and the emergence of the rescue effect, and more generally the stability of the whole metapopulation. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

         "Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression is a well-established feature of human cancer. However, the role of specific miRNAs in determining cancer outcomes remains unclear. Using Level 3 expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified 61 miRNAs that are associated with overall survival in 469 ovarian cancers profiled by microarray (p<0.01). We also identified 12 miRNAs that are associated with survival when miRNAs were profiled in the same specimens using Next Generation Sequencing (miRNA-Seq) (p<0.01). Surprisingly, only 1 miRNA transcript is associated with ovarian cancer survival in both datasets. Our analyses indicate that this discrepancy is due to the fact that miRNA levels reported by the two platforms correlate poorly, even after correcting for potential issues inherent to signal detection algorithms. Corrections for false discovery and microRNA abundance had minimal impact on this discrepancy. Further investigation is warranted. © 2014 Wan et al.",

         "Background: Chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single genome-shattering event. This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \" one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood.Results: Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate.Conclusions: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \" chromothripsis\" -definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \" chromthripsis\" phenomenon. © 2014 Cai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

         "Proteasome inhibition elicits an evolutionarily conserved response wherein proteasome subunit mRNAs are upregulated, resulting in recovery (i.e., 'bounce-back') of proteasome activity. We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf1/NFE2L1 mediates this homeostatic response in mammalian cells. We show here that Nrf1 is initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but is rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on p97/VCP. Normally, retrotranslocated Nrf1 is degraded promptly by the proteasome and active species do not accumulate. However, in cells with compromised proteasomes, retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved N-terminal to Leu-104 to yield a fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER membrane. Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon proteasome inhibition. Our data uncover an unexpected role for p97 in activation of a transcription factor by relocalizing it from the ER lumen to the cytosol. ©Radhakrishnan et al.",

         "Mutualistic interactions benefit both partners, promoting coexistence and genetic diversity. Spatial structure can promote cooperation, but spatial expansions may also make it hard for mutualistic partners to stay together, because genetic drift at the expansion front creates regions of low genetic and species diversity. To explore the antagonism between mutualism and genetic drift, we grew cross-feeding strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on agar surfaces as a model for mutualists undergoing spatial expansions. By supplying varying amounts of the exchanged nutrients, we tuned strength and symmetry of the mutualistic interaction. Strong mutualism suppresses genetic demixing during spatial expansions and thereby maintains diversity, but weak or asymmetric mutualism is overwhelmed by genetic drift even when mutualism is still beneficial, slowing growth and reducing diversity. Theoretical modeling using experimentally measured parameters predicts the size of demixed regions and how strong mutualism must be to survive a spatial expansion.",

         "We report the effects of posture and morphology on the static aerodynamic stability and control effectiveness of physical models based on the feathered dinosaur, † Microraptor gui, from the Cretaceous of China. Postures had similar lift and drag coefficients and were broadly similar when simplified metrics of gliding were considered, but they exhibited different stability characteristics depending on the position of the legs and the presence of feathers on the legs and the tail. Both stability and the function of appendages in generating maneuvering forces and torques changed as the glide angle or angle of attack were changed. These are significant because they represent an aerial environment that may have shifted during the evolution of directed aerial descent and other aerial behaviors. Certain movements were particularly effective (symmetric movements of the wings and tail in pitch, asymmetric wing movements, some tail movements). Other appendages altered their function from creating yaws at high angle of attack to rolls at low angle of attack, or reversed their function entirely. While † M. gui lived after † Archaeopteryx and likely represents a side experiment with feathered morphology, the general patterns of stability and control effectiveness suggested from the manipulations of forelimb, hindlimb and tail morphology here may help understand the evolution of flight control aerodynamics in vertebrates. Though these results rest on a single specimen, as further fossils with different morphologies are tested, the findings here could be applied in a phylogenetic context to reveal biomechanical constraints on extinct flyers arising from the need to maneuver.

         "Variation among individuals arises in part from differences in DNA sequences, but the genetic basis for variation in most traits, including common diseases, remains only partly understood. Many DNA variants influence phenotypes by altering the expression level of one or several genes. The effects of such variants can be detected as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Traditional eQTL mapping requires large-scale genotype and gene expression data for each individual in the study sample, which limits sample sizes to hundreds of individuals in both humans and model organisms and reduces statistical power. Consequently, many eQTL are probably missed, especially those with smaller effects. Furthermore, most studies use messenger RNA rather than protein abundance as the measure of gene expression. Studies that have used mass-spectrometry proteomics reported unexpected differences between eQTL and protein QTL (pQTL) for the same genes, but these studies have been even more limited in scope. Here we introduce a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We measure single-cell protein abundance through the use of green fluorescent protein tags in very large populations of genetically variable cells, and use pooled sequencing to compare allele frequencies across the genome in thousands of individuals with high versus low protein abundance. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci that we detected were clustered in 'hotspots' that influence multiple proteins, and some hotspots were found to influence more than half of the proteins that we examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",

         "The multispecies coalescent has provided important progress for evolutionary inferences, including increasing the statistical rigor and objectivity of comparisons among competing species delimitation models. However, Bayesian species delimitation methods typically require brute force integration over gene trees via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which introduces a large computation burden and precludes their application to genomic-scale data. Here we combine a recently introduced dynamic programming algorithm for estimating species trees that bypasses MCMC integration over gene trees with sophisticated methods for estimating marginal likelihoods, needed for Bayesian model selection, to provide a rigorous and computationally tractable technique for genome-wide species delimitation. We provide a critical yet simple correction that brings the likelihoods of different species trees, and more importantly their corresponding marginal likelihoods, to the same common denominator, which enables direct and accurate comparisons of competing species delimitation models using Bayes factors. We test this approach, which we call Bayes factor delimitation (*with genomic data; BFD*), using common species delimitation scenarios with computer simulations. Varying the numbers of loci and the number of samples suggest that the approach can distinguish the true model even with few loci and limited samples per species. Misspecification of the prior for population size θ has little impact on support for the true model. We apply the approach to West African forest geckos (Hemidactylus fasciatus complex) using genome-wide SNP data. This new Bayesian method for species delimitation builds on a growing trend for objective species delimitation methods with explicit model assumptions that are easily tested.

         "Many natural biological systems - such as biofilms, shells and skeletal tissues - are able to assemble multifunctional and environmentally responsive multiscale assemblies of living and non-living components. Here, by using inducible genetic circuits and cellular communication circuits to regulate Escherichia coli curli amyloid production, we show that E. coli cells can organize self-assembling amyloid fibrils across multiple length scales, producing amyloid-based materials that are either externally controllable or undergo autonomous patterning. We also interfaced curli fibrils with inorganic materials, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and quantum dots (QDs), and used these capabilities to create an environmentally responsive biofilm-based electrical switch, produce gold nanowires and nanorods, co-localize AuNPs with CdTe/CdS QDs to modulate QD fluorescence lifetimes, and nucleate the formation of fluorescent ZnS QDs.

         "The rice XA21 immune receptor kinase and the structurally related XA3 receptor confer immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR. © The Author 2014.",

         "Olfactory representations are shaped by brain state and respiration. The interaction and circuit substrates of these influences are unclear. Granule cells (GCs) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) are presumed to sculpt activity reaching the cortex via inhibition of mitral/tufted cells (MTs). GCs potentially make ensemble activity more sparse by facilitating lateral inhibition among MTs and/or enforce temporally precise activity locked to breathing. Yet the selectivity and temporal structure of wakeful GC activity are unknown. We recorded GCs in the MOB of anesthetized and awake mice and identified state-dependent features of odor coding and temporal patterning. Under anesthesia, GCs were sparsely active and strongly and synchronously coupled to respiration. Upon waking, GCs desynchronized, broadened their tuning and largely fired independently from respiration. Thus, during wakefulness, GCs exhibited stronger odor responses with less temporal structure. We propose that during wakefulness GCs may shape MT odor responses through broadened lateral interactions rather than respiratory synchronization. © 2014 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.",

         "Since the discovery of tumour initiating cells (TICs) in solid tumours, studies focussing on their role in cancer initiation and progression have abounded. The biological interrogation of these cells continues to yield volumes of information on their pro-tumourigenic behaviour, but actionable generalised conclusions have been scarce. Further, new information suggesting a dependence of tumour composition and growth on the microenvironment has yet to be studied theoretically. To address this point, we created a hybrid, discrete/continuous computational cellular automaton model of a generalised stem-cell driven tissue with a simple microenvironment. Using the model we explored the phenotypic traits inherent to the tumour initiating cells and the effect of the microenvironment on tissue growth. We identify the regions in phenotype parameter space where TICs are able to cause a disruption in homeostasis, leading to tissue overgrowth and tumour maintenance. As our parameters and model are non-specific, they could apply to any tissue TIC and do not assume specific genetic mutations. Targeting these phenotypic traits could represent a generalizable therapeutic strategy across cancer types. Further, we find that the microenvironmental variable does not strongly affect the outcomes, suggesting a need for direct feedback from the microenvironment onto stem-cell behaviour in future modelling endeavours. © 2014 Scott et al.",

         "The widespread and rapid adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies has afforded researchers the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of genome level processes that underlie evolutionary change, and perhaps more importantly, the links between genotype and phenotype. In particular, researchers interested in functional biology and adaptation have used these technologies to sequence mRNA transcriptomes of specific tissues, which in turn are often compared to other tissues, or other individuals with different phenotypes. While these techniques are extremely powerful, careful attention to data quality is required. In particular, because high-throughput sequencing is more error-prone than traditional Sanger sequencing, quality trimming of sequence reads should be an important step in all data processing pipelines. While several software packages for quality trimming exist, no general guidelines for the specifics of trimming have been developed. Here, using empirically derived sequence data, I provide general recommendations regarding the optimal strength of trimming, specifically in mRNA-Seq studies. Although very aggressive quality trimming is common, this study suggests that a more gentle trimming, specifically of those nucleotides whose PHRED score <2 or <5, is optimal for most studies across a wide variety of metrics. © 2014 MacManes.",

         "In functional connectivity analyses in BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) fMRI data, there is an ongoing debate on whether to correct global signals in fMRI time series data. Although the discussion has been ongoing in the fMRI community since the early days of fMRI data analyses, this subject has gained renewed attention in recent years due to the surging popularity of functional connectivity analyses, in particular graph theory-based network analyses. However, the impact of correcting (or not correcting) for global signals has not been systematically characterized in the context of network analyses. Thus, in this work, I examined the effect of global signal correction on an fMRI network analysis. In particular, voxel-based resting-state fMRI networks were constructed with and without global signal correction. The resulting functional connectivity networks were compared. Without global signal correction, the distributions of the correlation coefficients were positively biased. I also found that, without global signal correction, nodes along the interhemisphic fissure were highly connected whereas some nodes and subgraphs around white-matter tracts became disconnected from the rest of the network. These results from this study show differences between the networks with or without global signal correction. © 2013 Hayasaka.",

         "Biodiversity indices often combine data from different species when used in monitoring programs. Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. We developed 3 biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. We based the first index on the geometric mean abundance of species and the second on a more general power mean. In a third index, we integrated the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggested that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1% from 1970 to 2009.",

         "Evolutionary game theory has become one of the most diverse and far reaching theories in biology. Applications of this theory range from cell dynamics to social evolution. However, many applications make it clear that inherent non-linearities of natural systems need to be taken into account. One way of introducing such non-linearities into evolutionary games is by the inclusion of multiple players. An example are social dilemmas, where group benefits could e.g. increase less than linear with the number of cooperators. Such multiplayer games can be introduced in all the fields where evolutionary game theory is already well established. However, the inclusion of non-linearities can help to advance the analysis of systems which are known to be complex, e.g. in the case of non-Mendelian inheritance. We review the diachronic theory and applications of multiplayer evolutionary games and present the current state of the field. Our aim is a summary of the theoretical results from well-mixed populations in infinite as well as finite populations. We also discuss examples from three fields where the theory has been successfully applied, ecology, social sciences and population genetics. In closing, we probe certain future directions which can be explored using the complexity of multiplayer games while preserving the promise of simplicity of evolutionary games.",

         "We propose a negative feedback architecture that regulates activity of artificial genes, or \"genelets\", to meet their output downstream demand, achieving robustness with respect to uncertain open-loop output production rates. In particular, we consider the case where the outputs of two genelets interact to form a single assembled product. We show with analysis and experiments that negative autoregulation matches the production and demand of the outputs: the magnitude of the regulatory signal is proportional to the \"error\" between the circuit output concentration and its actual demand. This two-device system is experimentally implemented using in vitro transcriptional networks, where reactions are systematically designed by optimizing nucleic acid sequences with publicly available software packages. We build a predictive ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that captures the dynamics of the system and can be used to numerically assess the scalability of this architecture to larger sets of interconnected genes. Finally, with numerical simulations we contrast our negative autoregulation scheme with a cross-activation architecture, which is less scalable and results in slower response times. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",

         "The many successes of synthetic biology have come in a manner largely different from those in other engineering disciplines; in particular, without well-characterized and simplified prototyping environments to play a role analogous to wind-tunnels in aerodynamics and breadboards in electrical engineering. However, as the complexity of synthetic circuits increases, the benefits - in cost savings and design cycle time - of a more traditional engineering approach can be significant. We have recently developed an in vitro \"breadboard\" prototyping platform based on E. coli cell extract that allows biocircuits to operate in an environment considerably simpler than, but functionally similar to, in vivo. The simplicity of this system makes it a promising tool for rapid biocircuit design and testing, as well as for probing fundamental aspects of gene circuit operation normally masked by cellular complexity. In this work, we characterize the cell-free breadboard using real-time and simultaneous measurements of transcriptional and translational activities of a small set of reporter genes and a transcriptional activation cascade. We determine the effects of promoter strength, gene concentration, and nucleoside triphosphate concentration on biocircuit properties, and we isolate the specific contributions of essential biomolecular resources - core RNA polymerase and ribosomes - to overall performance. Importantly, we show how limits on resources, particularly those involved in translation, are manifested as reduced expression in the presence of orthogonal genes that serve as additional loads on the system. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",

         "This paper presents and tests a previously unrecognized mechanism for driving a replicating molecular system on the prebiotic earth. It is proposed that cell-free RNA replication in the primordial soup may have been driven by self-sustained oscillatory thermochemical reactions. To test this hypothesis, a well-characterized hydrogen peroxide oscillator was chosen as the driver and complementary RNA strands with known association and melting kinetics were used as the substrate. An open flow system model for the self-consistent, coupled evolution of the temperature and concentrations in a simple autocatalytic scheme is solved numerically, and it is shown that thermochemical cycling drives replication of the RNA strands. For the ( justifiably realistic) values of parameters chosen for the simulated example system, the mean amount of replicant produced at steady state is 6.56 times the input amount, given a constant supply of substrate species. The spontaneous onset of sustained thermochemical oscillations via slowly drifting parameters is demonstrated, and a scheme is given for prebiotic production of complementary RNA strands on rock surfaces. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

         "The increasing quantity and quality of functional genomic information motivate the assessment and integration of these data with association data, including data originating from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used previously described GWAS signals (\"hits\") to train a regularized logistic model in order to predict SNP causality on the basis of a large multivariate functional dataset. We show how this model can be used to derive Bayes factors for integrating functional and association data into a combined Bayesian analysis. Functional characteristics were obtained from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), from published expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and from other sources of genome-wide characteristics. We trained the model using all GWAS signals combined, and also using phenotype specific signals for autoimmune, brain-related, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. The non-phenotype specific and the autoimmune GWAS signals gave the most reliable results. We found SNPs with higher probabilities of causality from functional characteristics showed an enrichment of more significant p-values compared to all GWAS SNPs in three large GWAS studies of complex traits. We investigated the ability of our Bayesian method to improve the identification of true causal signals in a psoriasis GWAS dataset and found that combining functional data with association data improves the ability to prioritise novel hits. We used the predictions from the penalized logistic regression model to calculate Bayes factors relating to functional characteristics and supply these online alongside resources to integrate these data with association data. © 2014 Gagliano et al.",

         "Small molecule inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One inhibition strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. \"Pitstop\" compounds have been developed that block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-terminal domain interaction sites. We conclude that the inhibition observed with this compound is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes inhibition away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these compounds be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrin's N-terminal domain.",

         "We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers en route to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde-retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.",

         "Genome-wide profiling of open chromatin regions using DNase I and high-throughput sequencing (DNase-seq) is an increasingly popular approach for finding and studying regulatory elements. A variety of algorithms have been developed to identify regions of open chromatin from raw sequence-tag data, which has motivated us to assess and compare their performance. In this study, four published, publicly available peak calling algorithms used for DNase-seq data analysis (F-seq, Hotspot, MACS and ZINBA) are assessed at a range of signal thresholds on two published DNase-seq datasets for three cell types. The results were benchmarked against an independent dataset of regulatory regions derived from ENCODE in vivo transcription factor binding data for each particular cell type. The level of overlap between peak regions reported by each algorithm and this ENCODE-derived reference set was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our study suggests that F-seq has a slightly higher sensitivity than the next best algorithms. Hotspot and the ChIP-seq oriented method, MACS, both perform competitively when used with their default parameters. However the generic peak finder ZINBA appears to be less sensitive than the other three. We also assess accuracy of each algorithm over a range of signal thresholds. In particular, we show that the accuracy of F-Seq can be considerably improved by using a threshold setting that is different from the default value. © 2014 Koohy et al.",

         "Background: Transgenic constructs intended to be stably established at high frequencies in wild populations have been demonstrated to \"drive\" from low frequencies in experimental insect populations. Linking such population transformation constructs to genes which render them unable to transmit pathogens could eventually be used to stop the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue. Results: Generally, population transformation constructs with only a single transgenic drive mechanism have been envisioned. Using a theoretical modelling approach we describe the predicted properties of a construct combining autosomal Medea and underdominant population transformation systems. We show that when combined they can exhibit synergistic properties which in broad circumstances surpass those of the single systems. Conclusion: With combined systems, intentional population transformation and its reversal can be achieved readily. Combined constructs also enhance the capacity to geographically restrict transgenic constructs to targeted populations. It is anticipated that these properties are likely to be of particular value in attracting regulatory approval and public acceptance of this novel technology. © 2014 Gokhale et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

         "One of the key questions in biology is how the metabolism of a cell responds to changes in the environment. In budding yeast, starvation causes a drop in intracellular pH, but the functional role of this pH change is not well understood. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzyme inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between nutritional stress, the metabolism and the physical organization of a cell.",

         "Thrombopoietin (TPO) acting via its receptor, the cellular homologue of the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (Mpl), is the major cytokine regulator of platelet number. To precisely define the role of specific hematopoietic cells in TPO-dependent hematopoiesis, we generated mice that express the Mpl receptor normally on stem/progenitor cells but lack expression on megakaryocytes and platelets (MplPF4cre/PF4cre). Mpl PF4cre/PF4cre mice displayed profound megakaryocytosis and thrombocytosis with a remarkable expansion of megakaryocyte-committed and multipotential progenitor cells, the latter displaying biological responses and a gene expression signature indicative of chronic TPO overstimulation as the underlying causative mechanism, despite a normal circulating TPO level. Thus, TPO signaling in megakaryocytes is dispensable for platelet production; its key role in control of platelet number is via generation and stimulation of the bipotential megakaryocyte precursors. Nevertheless, Mpl expression on megakaryocytes and platelets is essential to prevent megakaryocytosis and myeloproliferation by restricting the amount of TPO available to stimulate the production of megakaryocytes from the progenitor cell pool.",

         "Principal component analysis (PCA) is routinely used to analyze genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, for detecting population structure and potential outliers. However, the size of SNP datasets has increased immensely in recent years and PCA of large datasets has become a time consuming task. We have developed flashpca, a highly efficient PCA implementation based on randomized algorithms, which delivers identical accuracy in extracting the top principal components compared with existing tools, in substantially less time. We demonstrate the utility of flashpca on both HapMap3 and on a large Immunochip dataset. For the latter, flashpca performed PCA of 15,000 individuals up to 125 times faster than existing tools, with identical results, and PCA of 150,000 individuals using flashpca completed in 4 hours. The increasing size of SNP datasets will make tools such as flashpca essential as traditional approaches will not adequately scale. This approach will also help to scale other applications that leverage PCA or eigen-decomposition to substantially larger datasets. © 2014 Abraham, Inouye.",

         "Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, choosing the relevant annotations for interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. I describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic elements that are enriched with or depleted of loci influencing a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. I applied the model to GWASs of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, body mass index, and Crohn disease. For each trait, I used the model to evaluate the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over 100 tissues and cell lines. The fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs influencing protein sequence ranged from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), repressed chromatin was significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits, and cell-type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites were enriched with SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, reweighting each GWAS by using information from functional genomics increased the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5%. © 2014 The American Society of Human Genetics.",

         "Understanding how an organism's nervous system transforms sensory input into behavioral outputs requires recording and manipulating its neural activity during unrestrained behavior. Here we present an instrument to simultaneously monitor and manipulate neural activity while observing behavior in a freely moving animal, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Neural activity is recorded optically from cells expressing a calcium indicator, GCaMP3. Neural activity is manipulated optically by illuminating targeted neurons expressing the optogenetic protein Channelrhodopsin. Real-time computer vision software tracks the animal's behavior and identifies the location of targeted neurons in the nematode as it crawls. Patterned illumination from a DMD is used to selectively illuminate subsets of neurons for either calcium imaging or optogenetic stimulation. Real-time computer vision software constantly updates the illumination pattern in response to the worm's movement and thereby allows for independent optical recording or activation of different neurons in the worm as it moves freely. We use the instrument to directly observe the relationship between sensory neuron activation, interneuron dynamics and locomotion in the worm's mechanosensory circuit. We record and compare calcium transients in the backward locomotion command interneurons AVA, in response to optical activation of the anterior mechanosensory neurons ALM, AVM or both. © 2014 Shipley, Clark, Alkema and Leifer.",

         "Predicting biological structure has remained challenging for systems such as disordered proteins that take on myriad conformations. Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computational model inaccuracies and data uncertainties. Building on recent proposals from maximum entropy theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we address these issues through a Bayesian energy landscape tilting (BELT) scheme for computing Bayesian hyperensembles over conformational ensembles. BELT uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to directly sample maximum-entropy conformational ensembles consistent with a set of input experimental observables. To test this framework, we apply BELT to model trialanine, starting from disagreeing simulations with the force fields ff96, ff99, ff99sbnmr-ildn, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA. BELT incorporation of limited chemical shift and 3J measurements gives convergent values of the peptide's α, β, and PPII conformational populations in all cases. As a test of predictive power, all five BELT hyperensembles recover set-aside measurements not used in the fitting and report accurate errors, even when starting from highly inaccurate simulations. BELT's principled framework thus enables practical predictions for complex biomolecular systems from discordant simulations and sparse data. © 2014 Biophysical Society.",

         "Hybrid zones can be valuable tools for studying evolution and identifying genomic regions responsible for adaptive divergence and underlying phenotypic variation. Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and are maintained by strong selection acting on color pattern. The comimetic species, H. erato and H. melpomene, have parallel hybrid zones in which both species undergo a change from one color pattern form to another. We use restriction-associated DNA sequencing to obtain several thousand genome-wide sequence markers and use these to analyze patterns of population divergence across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two approaches for analysis of this type of data - alignment to a reference genome and de novo assembly - and find that alignment gives the best results for species both closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. erato, ∼15% divergent) related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that the color pattern controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions across the genome, but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to color pattern differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously unmapped color pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus. Finally, we identify a new cryptic population of H. timareta in Ecuador, which occurs at relatively low altitude and is mimetic with H. melpomene malleti. © 2014 Nadeau et al.",

         "Many organisms live in populations structured by space and by class, exhibit plastic responses to their social partners, and are subject to nonadditive ecological and fitness effects. Social evolution theory has long recognized that all of these factors can lead to different selection pressures but has only recently attempted to synthesize how these factors interact. Using models for both discrete and continuous phenotypes, we show that analyzing these factors in a consistent framework reveals that they interact with one another in ways previously overlooked. Specifically, behavioral responses (reciprocity), genetic relatedness, and synergy interact in nontrivial ways that cannot be easily captured by simple summary indices of assortment. We demonstrate the importance of these interactions by showing how they have been neglected in previous synthetic models of social behavior both within and between species. These interactions also affect the level of behavioral responses that can evolve in the long run; proximate biological mechanisms are evolutionarily stable when they generate enough responsiveness relative to the level of responsiveness that exactly balances the ecological costs and benefits. Given the richness of social behavior across taxa, these interactions should be a boon for empirical research as they are likely crucial for describing the complex relationship linking ecology, demography, and social behavior. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",

         "The heritability of a trait (h2) is the proportion of its population variance caused by genetic differences, and estimates of this parameter are important for interpreting the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In recent years, researchers have adopted a novel method for estimating a lower bound on heritability directly from GWAS data that uses realized genetic similarities between nominally unrelated individuals. The quantity estimated by this method is purported to be the contribution to heritability that could in principle be recovered from association studies employing the given panel of SNPs (hSNP2). Thus far, the validity of this approach has mostly been tested empirically. Here, we provide a mathematical explication and show that the method should remain a robust means of obtaining hSNP2 under circumstances wider than those under which it has so far been derived. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",

         "Individuals can manipulate the behavior of social partners. However, manipulation may conflict with the fitness interests of the manipulated individuals. Manipulated individuals can then be favored to resist manipulation, possibly reducing or eliminating the manipulated behavior in the long run. I use a mathematical model to show that conflicts where manipulation and resistance coevolve can disappear as a result of the coevolutionary process. I find that while manipulated individuals are selected to resist, they can simultaneously be favored to express the manipulated behavior at higher efficiency (i.e., providing increasing fitness effects to recipients of the manipulated behavior). Efficiency can increase to a point at which selection for resistance disappears. This process yields an efficient social behavior that is induced by social partners, and over which the inducing and induced individuals are no longer in conflict. A necessary factor is costly inefficiency. I develop the model to address the evolution of advanced eusociality via maternal manipulation (AEMM). The model predicts AEMM to be particularly likely in taxa with ancestrally imperfect resistance to maternal manipulation. Costly inefficiency occurs if the cost of delayed dispersal is larger than the benefit of exploiting the maternal patch. I discuss broader implications of the process. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",

         "Spatial and environmental processes influence species composition at distinct scales. Previous studies suggested that the distribution of larval anurans at the landscape-scale is influenced by environmental gradients related to adult breeding site selection, such as pond canopy cover, but not by water chemistry. However, the combined effects of spatial, pond morphology, and water chemistry variables on metacommunity structure of larval anurans have not been analyzed yet. We used a partial redundancy analysis with variation partitioning to analyze the relative influence of pond morphology (e.g., depth, area, and aquatic vegetation), water chemistry, and spatial variables on a tadpole metacommunity from southeastern Brazil. We predict that pond morphology and canopy cover will influence the metacommunity at broad spatial scales, while water chemistry would play a larger role at finer scales. We found that broad-scale spatial patterns of pond canopy cover and pond morphology strongly influenced metacommunity structure, with water chemistry being not significant. Additionally, species composition was spatially autocorrelated at short distances. We suggest that the reproductive behavior of adult anurans is driving tadpole metacommunity dynamics, since pond morphology, but not water chemistry affects breeding site selection by adults. Our results contribute to the understanding of amphibian species diversity in tropical wetlands. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",

         "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex disease driven by myriad interactions of genetics and environmental factors. Traditionally, studies have analyzed only 1 disease factor at a time, providing useful but limited understanding of the underlying etiology. Recent advances in cost-effective and high-throughput technologies, such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, exome/genome/RNA sequencing, gene expression microarrays, and metabolomics assays have enabled the collection of millions of data points in many thousands of individuals. In order to make sense of such 'omics' data, effective analytical methods are needed. We review and highlight some of the main results in this area, focusing on integrative approaches that consider multiple modalities simultaneously. Such analyses have the potential to uncover the genetic basis of CAD, produce genomic risk scores (GRS) for disease prediction, disentangle the complex interactions underlying disease, and predict response to treatment. © The Author(s) 2014.",

         "Temperature affects both the timing and outcome of animal development, but the detailed effects of temperature on the progress of early development have been poorly characterized. To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5°C and 32.5°C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004293.e003\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"/></inline-formula>33 hours at 17.5°C, and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5°C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D. melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly, develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D. virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration above 22.5°C and have drastically slowed development by 30°C. Despite ranging from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30°C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5°C, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across all species and temperatures examined here, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized timer controlling the progress of embryogenesis that has been tuned by natural selection as each species diverges. © 2014 Kuntz, Eisen.",

         "Normal mode analysis (NMA) methods are widely used to study dynamic aspects of protein structures. Two critical components of NMA methods are coarse-graining in the level of simplification used to represent protein structures and the choice of potential energy functional form. There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy in different choices. In one extreme one finds accurate but slow molecular-dynamics based methods with all-atom representations and detailed atom potentials. On the other extreme, fast elastic network model (ENM) methods with Cα-only representations and simplified potentials that based on geometry alone, thus oblivious to protein sequence. Here we present ENCoM, an Elastic Network Contact Model that employs a potential energy function that includes a pairwise atom-type non-bonded interaction term and thus makes it possible to consider the effect of the specific nature of amino-acids on dynamics within the context of NMA. ENCoM is as fast as existing ENM methods and outperforms such methods in the generation of conformational ensembles. Here we introduce a new application for NMA methods with the use of ENCoM in the prediction of the effect of mutations on protein stability. While existing methods are based on machine learning or enthalpic considerations, the use of ENCoM, based on vibrational normal modes, is based on entropic considerations. This represents a novel area of application for NMA methods and a novel approach for the prediction of the effect of mutations. We compare ENCoM to a large number of methods in terms of accuracy and self-consistency. We show that the accuracy of ENCoM is comparable to that of the best existing methods. We show that existing methods are biased towards the prediction of destabilizing mutations and that ENCoM is less biased at predicting stabilizing mutations. © 2014 Frappier, Najmanovich.",

         "With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, many large scale experimental efforts aim to map genotypic variability among individuals. This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes, ranging from evolutionary adaptation and speciation to the spread of genetic diseases and drug resistance. An interesting and important component of this variability is present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability, gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the fold-change in gene expression. The model combines single-base pair resolution maps of transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding energies with a comprehensive thermodynamic model of gene regulation. The model was validated by predicting and then measuring the variability of lac operon regulation in a collection of natural isolates. We then implement the model to analyze the sensitivity of the promoter sequence to the regulatory output, and predict the potential for regulation to evolve due to point mutations in the promoter region. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

         "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common form of inherited mental retardation, is caused by a loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is involved in brain functions by interacting with mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that selectively control gene expression at translational level. However, little is known about the role of FMRP in regulating miRNA expression. Here, we found a development-dependant dynamic expression of Fmr1 gene (encoding FMRP) in mouse hippocampus with a small peak at postnatal day 7 (P7). MiRNA microarray analysis showed that the levels of 38 miRNAs showed a significant increase with about 15 ~ 250-folds and the levels of 26 miRNAs showed a significant decrease with only about 2 ~ 4-folds in the hippocampus of P7 Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. The qRT-PCR assay showed that nine of the most increased miRNAs (>100-folds in microarrays) increased about 40 ~ 70-folds and their pre-miRNAs increased about 5 ~ 10-folds, but no significant difference in their pri-miRNA levels was observed, suggesting that the alterations of partial miRNAs are an indirect consequence of FMRP lacking. We further demonstrated that a set of protein-coding mRNAs, potentially targeted by the nine miRNAs, were down-regulated in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-34b, miR-340, and miR-148a could down-regulate the reporter gene expression by interacting with the Met 3′ UTR. Taken together, these findings suggest that the miRNA expression alterations resulted from the absence of FMRP might contribute to molecular pathology of FXS.",

         "As a field, synthetic biology strives to engineer increasingly complex artificial systems in living cells. Active feedback in closed loop systems offers a dynamic and adaptive way to ensure constant relative activity independent of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. In this work, we use synthetic protein scaffolds as a modular and tunable mechanism for concentration tracking through negative feedback. Input to the circuit initiates scaffold production, leading to colocalization of a two-component system and resulting in the production of an inhibitory antiscaffold protein. Using a combination of modeling and experimental work, we show that the biomolecular concentration tracker circuit achieves dynamic protein concentration tracking in Escherichia coli and that steady state outputs can be tuned.",

         "RNA regulators are emerging as powerful tools to engineer synthetic genetic networks or rewire existing ones. A potential strength of RNA networks is that they may be able to propagate signals on time scales that are set by the fast degradation rates of RNAs. However, a current bottleneck to verifying this potential is the slow design-build-test cycle of evaluating these networks in vivo. Here, we adapt an Escherichia coli-based cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system for rapidly prototyping RNA networks. We used this system to measure the response time of an RNA transcription cascade to be approximately five minutes per step of the cascade. We also show that this response time can be adjusted with temperature and regulator threshold tuning. Finally, we use TX-TL to prototype a new RNA network, an RNA single input module, and show that this network temporally stages the expression of two genes in vivo. (Figure Presented).",

         "Motivation: Restriction-site-associated genomic markers are a powerful tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the population level, but are limited in their utility at deeper phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically recovered across disparate taxa. While this limitation stems in part from mutations to restriction recognition sites that disrupt data generation, an additional source of data loss comes from the failure to identify homology during bioinformatic analyses. Clustering methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at assembling RADseq loci at the phylogenetic scale. Results: PyRAD is a pipeline to assemble de novo RADseq loci with the aim of optimizing coverage across phylogenetic datasets. It uses a wrapper around an alignment-clustering algorithm, which allows for indel variation within and between samples, as well as for incomplete overlap among reads (e.g. paired-end). Here I compare PyRAD with the program Stacks in their performance analyzing a simulated RADseq dataset that includes indel variation. Indels disrupt clustering of homologous loci in Stacks but not in PyRAD, such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate taxa. I show through reanalysis of an empirical RADseq dataset that indels are a common feature of such data, even at shallow phylogenetic scales. PyRAD uses parallel processing as well as an optional hierarchical clustering method, which allows it to rapidly assemble phylogenetic datasets with hundreds of sampled individuals. © The Author 2014.",

         "Background: During early development, neural circuits fire spontaneously, generating activity episodes with complex spatiotemporal patterns. Recordings of spontaneous activity have been made in many parts of the nervous system over the last 25 years, reporting developmental changes in activity patterns and the effects of various genetic perturbations. Results: We present a curated repository of multielectrode array recordings of spontaneous activity in developing mouse and ferret retina. The data have been annotated with minimal metadata and converted into HDF5. This paper describes the structure of the data, along with examples of reproducible research using these data files. We also demonstrate how these data can be analysed in the CARMEN workflow system. This article is written as a literate programming document; all programs and data described here are freely available.Conclusions: 1. We hope this repository will lead to novel analysis of spontaneous activity recorded in different laboratories. 2. We encourage published data to be added to the repository. 3. This repository serves as an example of how multielectrode array recordings can be stored for long-term reuse.",

         "Key biological properties such as high genetic diversity and high evolutionary rate enhance the potential of certain RNA viruses to adapt and emerge. Identifying viruses with these properties in their natural hosts could dramatically improve disease forecasting and surveillance. Recently, we discovered two novel members of the viral family Arteriviridae : simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV)-krc1 and SHFV-krc2, infecting a single wild red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Nearly nothing is known about the biological properties of SHFVs in nature, although the SHFV type strain, SHFV-LVR, has caused devastating outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in captive macaques. Here we detected SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 in 40% and 47% of 60 wild red colobus tested, respectively. We found viral loads in excess of 106-107 RNA copies per milliliter of blood plasma for each of these viruses. SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 also showed high genetic diversity at both the inter- and intra-host levels. Analyses of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide diversity across viral genomes revealed patterns suggestive of positive selection in SHFV open reading frames (ORF) 5 (SHFV-krc2 only) and 7 (SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2). Thus, these viruses share several important properties with some of the most rapidly evolving, emergent RNA viruses.",

         "The non-protein amino acid β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) can induce plant resistance to a broad spectrum of biotic and abiotic stresses. However, BABA-induced plant resistance to insects is less well-studied, especially its underlying mechanism. In this research, we applied BABA to wheat seedlings and tested its effects on Sitobion avenae (F.). When applied as a soil drench, BABA significantly reduced weights of S. avenae, whereas foliar spray and seed treatment had no such effects. BABA-mediated suppression of S. avenae growth was dose dependent and lasted at least for 7 days. The aminobutyric acid concentration in phloem sap of BABA-treated plants was higher and increased with BABA concentrations applied. Moreover, after 10 days of treatment, the aminobutyric acid content in BABA-treated plants was still higher than that in control treatment. Sitobion avenae could not discriminate artificial diet containing BABA from standard diet, indicating that BABA itself is not a deterrent to this aphid. Also S. avenae did not show preference for control plants or BABA-treated plants. Consistent with choice test results, S. avenae had similar feeding activities on control and BABA-treated plants, suggesting that BABA did not induce antifeedants in wheat seedlings. In addition, aminobutyric acid concentration in S. avenae feeding on BABA-treated plants was significantly higher than those feeding on control plants. Sitobion avenae growth rate was reduced on the artificial diet containing BABA, indicating that BABA had direct toxic effects on this aphid species. These results suggest that BABA application reduced S. avenae performance on wheat seedlings and the mechanism is possibly due to direct toxicity of high BABA contents in plant phloem. © 2014 Cao et al.",

         "Motivated by data-rich experiments in transcriptional regulation and sensory neuroscience, we consider the following general problem in statistical inference: when exposed to a high-dimensional signal S, a system of interest computes a representation R of that signal, which is then observed through a noisy measurement M. From a large number of signals and measurements, we wish to infer the \"filter\" that maps S to R. However, the standard method for solving such problems, likelihood-based inference, requires perfect a priori knowledge of the \"noise function\" mapping R to M. In practice such noise functions are usually known only approximately, if at all, and using an incorrect noise function will typically bias the inferred filter. Here we show that in the large data limit, this need for a precharacterized noise function can be circumvented by searching for filters that instead maximize the mutual information I[M;R] between observed measurements and predicted representations. Moreover, if the correct filter lies within the space of filters being explored, maximizing mutual information becomes equivalent to simultaneously maximizing every dependence measure that satisfies the data processing inequality. It is important to note that maximizing mutual information will typically leave a small number of directions in parameter space unconstrained. We term these directions diffeomorphic modes and present an equation that allows these modes to be derived systematically. The presence of diffeomorphic modes reflects a fundamental and nontrivial substructure within parameter space, one that is obscured by standard likelihood-based inference. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",

         "Apicomplexan parasites are thought to actively invade the host cell by gliding motility. This movement is powered by the parasite's own actomyosin system, and depends on the regulated polymerisation and depolymerisation of actin to generate the force for gliding and host cell penetration. Recent studies demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii can invade the host cell in the absence of several core components of the invasion machinery, such as the motor protein myosin A (MyoA), the microneme proteins MIC2 and AMA1 and actin, indicating the presence of alternative invasion mechanisms. Here the roles of MyoA, MLC1, GAP45 and Act1, core components of the gliding machinery, are re-dissected in detail. Although important roles of these components for gliding motility and host cell invasion are verified, mutant parasites remain invasive and do not show a block of gliding motility, suggesting that other mechanisms must be in place to enable the parasite to move and invade the host cell. A novel, hypothetical model for parasite gliding motility and invasion is presented based on osmotic forces generated in the cytosol of the parasite that are converted into motility. © 2014 Egarter et al.",

         "Conjugation is the primary mechanism of horizontal gene transfer that spreads antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Although conjugation normally occurs in surface-associated growth (e.g., biofilms), it has been traditionally studied in well-mixed liquid cultures lacking spatial structure, which is known to affect many evolutionary and ecological processes. Here we visualize spatial patterns of gene transfer mediated by F plasmid conjugation in a colony of Escherichia coli growing on solid agar, and we develop a quantitative understanding by spatial extension of traditional mass-action models. We found that spatial structure suppresses conjugation in surface-associated growth because strong genetic drift leads to spatial isolation of donor and recipient cells, restricting conjugation to rare boundaries between donor and recipient strains. These results suggest that ecological strategies, such as enforcement of spatial structure and enhancement of genetic drift, could complement molecular strategies in slowing the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. © 2014 Biophysical Society.",

         "Immigration can rescue local populations from extinction, helping to stabilize a metapopulation. Local population dynamics is important for determining the strength of this rescue effect, but the mechanistic link between local demographic parameters and the rescue effect at the metapopulation level has received very little attention by modellers. We develop an analytical framework that allows us to describe the emergence of the rescue effect from interacting local stochastic dynamics. We show this framework to be applicable to a wide range of spatial scales, providing a powerful and convenient alternative to individual-based models for making predictions concerning the fate of metapopulations. We show that the rescue effect plays an important role in minimizing the increase in local extinction probability associated with high demographic stochasticity, but its role is more limited in the case of high local environmental stochasticity of recruitment or survival. While most models postulate the rescue effect, our framework provides an explicit mechanistic link between local dynamics and the emergence of the rescue effect, and more generally the stability of the whole metapopulation. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

         "Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression is a well-established feature of human cancer. However, the role of specific miRNAs in determining cancer outcomes remains unclear. Using Level 3 expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified 61 miRNAs that are associated with overall survival in 469 ovarian cancers profiled by microarray (p<0.01). We also identified 12 miRNAs that are associated with survival when miRNAs were profiled in the same specimens using Next Generation Sequencing (miRNA-Seq) (p<0.01). Surprisingly, only 1 miRNA transcript is associated with ovarian cancer survival in both datasets. Our analyses indicate that this discrepancy is due to the fact that miRNA levels reported by the two platforms correlate poorly, even after correcting for potential issues inherent to signal detection algorithms. Corrections for false discovery and microRNA abundance had minimal impact on this discrepancy. Further investigation is warranted. © 2014 Wan et al.",

         "Background: Chromothripsis is a recently discovered phenomenon of genomic rearrangement, possibly arising during a single genome-shattering event. This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \" one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood.Results: Here, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate.Conclusions: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \" chromothripsis\" -definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \" chromthripsis\" phenomenon. © 2014 Cai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

         "Proteasome inhibition elicits an evolutionarily conserved response wherein proteasome subunit mRNAs are upregulated, resulting in recovery (i.e., 'bounce-back') of proteasome activity. We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf1/NFE2L1 mediates this homeostatic response in mammalian cells. We show here that Nrf1 is initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but is rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on p97/VCP. Normally, retrotranslocated Nrf1 is degraded promptly by the proteasome and active species do not accumulate. However, in cells with compromised proteasomes, retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved N-terminal to Leu-104 to yield a fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER membrane. Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon proteasome inhibition. Our data uncover an unexpected role for p97 in activation of a transcription factor by relocalizing it from the ER lumen to the cytosol. ©Radhakrishnan et al.",

         "Mutualistic interactions benefit both partners, promoting coexistence and genetic diversity. Spatial structure can promote cooperation, but spatial expansions may also make it hard for mutualistic partners to stay together, because genetic drift at the expansion front creates regions of low genetic and species diversity. To explore the antagonism between mutualism and genetic drift, we grew cross-feeding strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on agar surfaces as a model for mutualists undergoing spatial expansions. By supplying varying amounts of the exchanged nutrients, we tuned strength and symmetry of the mutualistic interaction. Strong mutualism suppresses genetic demixing during spatial expansions and thereby maintains diversity, but weak or asymmetric mutualism is overwhelmed by genetic drift even when mutualism is still beneficial, slowing growth and reducing diversity. Theoretical modeling using experimentally measured parameters predicts the size of demixed regions and how strong mutualism must be to survive a spatial expansion.",

         "We report the effects of posture and morphology on the static aerodynamic stability and control effectiveness of physical models based on the feathered dinosaur, † Microraptor gui, from the Cretaceous of China. Postures had similar lift and drag coefficients and were broadly similar when simplified metrics of gliding were considered, but they exhibited different stability characteristics depending on the position of the legs and the presence of feathers on the legs and the tail. Both stability and the function of appendages in generating maneuvering forces and torques changed as the glide angle or angle of attack were changed. These are significant because they represent an aerial environment that may have shifted during the evolution of directed aerial descent and other aerial behaviors. Certain movements were particularly effective (symmetric movements of the wings and tail in pitch, asymmetric wing movements, some tail movements). Other appendages altered their function from creating yaws at high angle of attack to rolls at low angle of attack, or reversed their function entirely. While † M. gui lived after † Archaeopteryx and likely represents a side experiment with feathered morphology, the general patterns of stability and control effectiveness suggested from the manipulations of forelimb, hindlimb and tail morphology here may help understand the evolution of flight control aerodynamics in vertebrates. Though these results rest on a single specimen, as further fossils with different morphologies are tested, the findings here could be applied in a phylogenetic context to reveal biomechanical constraints on extinct flyers arising from the need to maneuver.

         "Variation among individuals arises in part from differences in DNA sequences, but the genetic basis for variation in most traits, including common diseases, remains only partly understood. Many DNA variants influence phenotypes by altering the expression level of one or several genes. The effects of such variants can be detected as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Traditional eQTL mapping requires large-scale genotype and gene expression data for each individual in the study sample, which limits sample sizes to hundreds of individuals in both humans and model organisms and reduces statistical power. Consequently, many eQTL are probably missed, especially those with smaller effects. Furthermore, most studies use messenger RNA rather than protein abundance as the measure of gene expression. Studies that have used mass-spectrometry proteomics reported unexpected differences between eQTL and protein QTL (pQTL) for the same genes, but these studies have been even more limited in scope. Here we introduce a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We measure single-cell protein abundance through the use of green fluorescent protein tags in very large populations of genetically variable cells, and use pooled sequencing to compare allele frequencies across the genome in thousands of individuals with high versus low protein abundance. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci that we detected were clustered in 'hotspots' that influence multiple proteins, and some hotspots were found to influence more than half of the proteins that we examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",

         "The multispecies coalescent has provided important progress for evolutionary inferences, including increasing the statistical rigor and objectivity of comparisons among competing species delimitation models. However, Bayesian species delimitation methods typically require brute force integration over gene trees via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which introduces a large computation burden and precludes their application to genomic-scale data. Here we combine a recently introduced dynamic programming algorithm for estimating species trees that bypasses MCMC integration over gene trees with sophisticated methods for estimating marginal likelihoods, needed for Bayesian model selection, to provide a rigorous and computationally tractable technique for genome-wide species delimitation. We provide a critical yet simple correction that brings the likelihoods of different species trees, and more importantly their corresponding marginal likelihoods, to the same common denominator, which enables direct and accurate comparisons of competing species delimitation models using Bayes factors. We test this approach, which we call Bayes factor delimitation (*with genomic data; BFD*), using common species delimitation scenarios with computer simulations. Varying the numbers of loci and the number of samples suggest that the approach can distinguish the true model even with few loci and limited samples per species. Misspecification of the prior for population size θ has little impact on support for the true model. We apply the approach to West African forest geckos (Hemidactylus fasciatus complex) using genome-wide SNP data. This new Bayesian method for species delimitation builds on a growing trend for objective species delimitation methods with explicit model assumptions that are easily tested.

         "Many natural biological systems - such as biofilms, shells and skeletal tissues - are able to assemble multifunctional and environmentally responsive multiscale assemblies of living and non-living components. Here, by using inducible genetic circuits and cellular communication circuits to regulate Escherichia coli curli amyloid production, we show that E. coli cells can organize self-assembling amyloid fibrils across multiple length scales, producing amyloid-based materials that are either externally controllable or undergo autonomous patterning. We also interfaced curli fibrils with inorganic materials, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and quantum dots (QDs), and used these capabilities to create an environmentally responsive biofilm-based electrical switch, produce gold nanowires and nanorods, co-localize AuNPs with CdTe/CdS QDs to modulate QD fluorescence lifetimes, and nucleate the formation of fluorescent ZnS QDs.

         "The rice XA21 immune receptor kinase and the structurally related XA3 receptor confer immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight. Here we report the isolation of OsSERK2 (rice somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 2) and demonstrate that OsSERK2 positively regulates immunity mediated by XA21 and XA3 as well as the rice immune receptor FLS2 (OsFLS2). Rice plants silenced for OsSerk2 display altered morphology and reduced sensitivity to the hormone brassinolide. OsSERK2 interacts with the intracellular domains of each immune receptor in the yeast two-hybrid system in a kinase activity-dependent manner. OsSERK2 undergoes bidirectional transphosphorylation with XA21 in vitro and forms a constitutive complex with XA21 in vivo. These results demonstrate an essential role for OsSERK2 in the function of three rice immune receptors and suggest that direct interaction with the rice immune receptors is critical for their function. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mechanism of OsSERK2-meditated regulation of rice XA21, XA3, and FLS2 differs from that of AtSERK3/BAK1-mediated regulation of Arabidopsis FLS2 and EFR. © The Author 2014.",

         "Olfactory representations are shaped by brain state and respiration. The interaction and circuit substrates of these influences are unclear. Granule cells (GCs) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) are presumed to sculpt activity reaching the cortex via inhibition of mitral/tufted cells (MTs). GCs potentially make ensemble activity more sparse by facilitating lateral inhibition among MTs and/or enforce temporally precise activity locked to breathing. Yet the selectivity and temporal structure of wakeful GC activity are unknown. We recorded GCs in the MOB of anesthetized and awake mice and identified state-dependent features of odor coding and temporal patterning. Under anesthesia, GCs were sparsely active and strongly and synchronously coupled to respiration. Upon waking, GCs desynchronized, broadened their tuning and largely fired independently from respiration. Thus, during wakefulness, GCs exhibited stronger odor responses with less temporal structure. We propose that during wakefulness GCs may shape MT odor responses through broadened lateral interactions rather than respiratory synchronization. © 2014 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.",

         "Since the discovery of tumour initiating cells (TICs) in solid tumours, studies focussing on their role in cancer initiation and progression have abounded. The biological interrogation of these cells continues to yield volumes of information on their pro-tumourigenic behaviour, but actionable generalised conclusions have been scarce. Further, new information suggesting a dependence of tumour composition and growth on the microenvironment has yet to be studied theoretically. To address this point, we created a hybrid, discrete/continuous computational cellular automaton model of a generalised stem-cell driven tissue with a simple microenvironment. Using the model we explored the phenotypic traits inherent to the tumour initiating cells and the effect of the microenvironment on tissue growth. We identify the regions in phenotype parameter space where TICs are able to cause a disruption in homeostasis, leading to tissue overgrowth and tumour maintenance. As our parameters and model are non-specific, they could apply to any tissue TIC and do not assume specific genetic mutations. Targeting these phenotypic traits could represent a generalizable therapeutic strategy across cancer types. Further, we find that the microenvironmental variable does not strongly affect the outcomes, suggesting a need for direct feedback from the microenvironment onto stem-cell behaviour in future modelling endeavours. © 2014 Scott et al.",

         "The widespread and rapid adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies has afforded researchers the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of genome level processes that underlie evolutionary change, and perhaps more importantly, the links between genotype and phenotype. In particular, researchers interested in functional biology and adaptation have used these technologies to sequence mRNA transcriptomes of specific tissues, which in turn are often compared to other tissues, or other individuals with different phenotypes. While these techniques are extremely powerful, careful attention to data quality is required. In particular, because high-throughput sequencing is more error-prone than traditional Sanger sequencing, quality trimming of sequence reads should be an important step in all data processing pipelines. While several software packages for quality trimming exist, no general guidelines for the specifics of trimming have been developed. Here, using empirically derived sequence data, I provide general recommendations regarding the optimal strength of trimming, specifically in mRNA-Seq studies. Although very aggressive quality trimming is common, this study suggests that a more gentle trimming, specifically of those nucleotides whose PHRED score <2 or <5, is optimal for most studies across a wide variety of metrics. © 2014 MacManes.",

         "In functional connectivity analyses in BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) fMRI data, there is an ongoing debate on whether to correct global signals in fMRI time series data. Although the discussion has been ongoing in the fMRI community since the early days of fMRI data analyses, this subject has gained renewed attention in recent years due to the surging popularity of functional connectivity analyses, in particular graph theory-based network analyses. However, the impact of correcting (or not correcting) for global signals has not been systematically characterized in the context of network analyses. Thus, in this work, I examined the effect of global signal correction on an fMRI network analysis. In particular, voxel-based resting-state fMRI networks were constructed with and without global signal correction. The resulting functional connectivity networks were compared. Without global signal correction, the distributions of the correlation coefficients were positively biased. I also found that, without global signal correction, nodes along the interhemisphic fissure were highly connected whereas some nodes and subgraphs around white-matter tracts became disconnected from the rest of the network. These results from this study show differences between the networks with or without global signal correction. © 2013 Hayasaka.",

         "Biodiversity indices often combine data from different species when used in monitoring programs. Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. We developed 3 biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. We based the first index on the geometric mean abundance of species and the second on a more general power mean. In a third index, we integrated the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggested that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1% from 1970 to 2009.",

         "Evolutionary game theory has become one of the most diverse and far reaching theories in biology. Applications of this theory range from cell dynamics to social evolution. However, many applications make it clear that inherent non-linearities of natural systems need to be taken into account. One way of introducing such non-linearities into evolutionary games is by the inclusion of multiple players. An example are social dilemmas, where group benefits could e.g. increase less than linear with the number of cooperators. Such multiplayer games can be introduced in all the fields where evolutionary game theory is already well established. However, the inclusion of non-linearities can help to advance the analysis of systems which are known to be complex, e.g. in the case of non-Mendelian inheritance. We review the diachronic theory and applications of multiplayer evolutionary games and present the current state of the field. Our aim is a summary of the theoretical results from well-mixed populations in infinite as well as finite populations. We also discuss examples from three fields where the theory has been successfully applied, ecology, social sciences and population genetics. In closing, we probe certain future directions which can be explored using the complexity of multiplayer games while preserving the promise of simplicity of evolutionary games.",

         "We propose a negative feedback architecture that regulates activity of artificial genes, or \"genelets\", to meet their output downstream demand, achieving robustness with respect to uncertain open-loop output production rates. In particular, we consider the case where the outputs of two genelets interact to form a single assembled product. We show with analysis and experiments that negative autoregulation matches the production and demand of the outputs: the magnitude of the regulatory signal is proportional to the \"error\" between the circuit output concentration and its actual demand. This two-device system is experimentally implemented using in vitro transcriptional networks, where reactions are systematically designed by optimizing nucleic acid sequences with publicly available software packages. We build a predictive ordinary differential equation (ODE) model that captures the dynamics of the system and can be used to numerically assess the scalability of this architecture to larger sets of interconnected genes. Finally, with numerical simulations we contrast our negative autoregulation scheme with a cross-activation architecture, which is less scalable and results in slower response times. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",

         "The many successes of synthetic biology have come in a manner largely different from those in other engineering disciplines; in particular, without well-characterized and simplified prototyping environments to play a role analogous to wind-tunnels in aerodynamics and breadboards in electrical engineering. However, as the complexity of synthetic circuits increases, the benefits - in cost savings and design cycle time - of a more traditional engineering approach can be significant. We have recently developed an in vitro \"breadboard\" prototyping platform based on E. coli cell extract that allows biocircuits to operate in an environment considerably simpler than, but functionally similar to, in vivo. The simplicity of this system makes it a promising tool for rapid biocircuit design and testing, as well as for probing fundamental aspects of gene circuit operation normally masked by cellular complexity. In this work, we characterize the cell-free breadboard using real-time and simultaneous measurements of transcriptional and translational activities of a small set of reporter genes and a transcriptional activation cascade. We determine the effects of promoter strength, gene concentration, and nucleoside triphosphate concentration on biocircuit properties, and we isolate the specific contributions of essential biomolecular resources - core RNA polymerase and ribosomes - to overall performance. Importantly, we show how limits on resources, particularly those involved in translation, are manifested as reduced expression in the presence of orthogonal genes that serve as additional loads on the system. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",

         "This paper presents and tests a previously unrecognized mechanism for driving a replicating molecular system on the prebiotic earth. It is proposed that cell-free RNA replication in the primordial soup may have been driven by self-sustained oscillatory thermochemical reactions. To test this hypothesis, a well-characterized hydrogen peroxide oscillator was chosen as the driver and complementary RNA strands with known association and melting kinetics were used as the substrate. An open flow system model for the self-consistent, coupled evolution of the temperature and concentrations in a simple autocatalytic scheme is solved numerically, and it is shown that thermochemical cycling drives replication of the RNA strands. For the ( justifiably realistic) values of parameters chosen for the simulated example system, the mean amount of replicant produced at steady state is 6.56 times the input amount, given a constant supply of substrate species. The spontaneous onset of sustained thermochemical oscillations via slowly drifting parameters is demonstrated, and a scheme is given for prebiotic production of complementary RNA strands on rock surfaces. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

         "The increasing quantity and quality of functional genomic information motivate the assessment and integration of these data with association data, including data originating from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used previously described GWAS signals (\"hits\") to train a regularized logistic model in order to predict SNP causality on the basis of a large multivariate functional dataset. We show how this model can be used to derive Bayes factors for integrating functional and association data into a combined Bayesian analysis. Functional characteristics were obtained from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), from published expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and from other sources of genome-wide characteristics. We trained the model using all GWAS signals combined, and also using phenotype specific signals for autoimmune, brain-related, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. The non-phenotype specific and the autoimmune GWAS signals gave the most reliable results. We found SNPs with higher probabilities of causality from functional characteristics showed an enrichment of more significant p-values compared to all GWAS SNPs in three large GWAS studies of complex traits. We investigated the ability of our Bayesian method to improve the identification of true causal signals in a psoriasis GWAS dataset and found that combining functional data with association data improves the ability to prioritise novel hits. We used the predictions from the penalized logistic regression model to calculate Bayes factors relating to functional characteristics and supply these online alongside resources to integrate these data with association data. © 2014 Gagliano et al.",

         "Small molecule inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One inhibition strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. \"Pitstop\" compounds have been developed that block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-terminal domain interaction sites. We conclude that the inhibition observed with this compound is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes inhibition away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these compounds be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrin's N-terminal domain.",

         "We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers en route to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde-retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.",

         "Genome-wide profiling of open chromatin regions using DNase I and high-throughput sequencing (DNase-seq) is an increasingly popular approach for finding and studying regulatory elements. A variety of algorithms have been developed to identify regions of open chromatin from raw sequence-tag data, which has motivated us to assess and compare their performance. In this study, four published, publicly available peak calling algorithms used for DNase-seq data analysis (F-seq, Hotspot, MACS and ZINBA) are assessed at a range of signal thresholds on two published DNase-seq datasets for three cell types. The results were benchmarked against an independent dataset of regulatory regions derived from ENCODE in vivo transcription factor binding data for each particular cell type. The level of overlap between peak regions reported by each algorithm and this ENCODE-derived reference set was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our study suggests that F-seq has a slightly higher sensitivity than the next best algorithms. Hotspot and the ChIP-seq oriented method, MACS, both perform competitively when used with their default parameters. However the generic peak finder ZINBA appears to be less sensitive than the other three. We also assess accuracy of each algorithm over a range of signal thresholds. In particular, we show that the accuracy of F-Seq can be considerably improved by using a threshold setting that is different from the default value. © 2014 Koohy et al.",

         "Background: Transgenic constructs intended to be stably established at high frequencies in wild populations have been demonstrated to \"drive\" from low frequencies in experimental insect populations. Linking such population transformation constructs to genes which render them unable to transmit pathogens could eventually be used to stop the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue. Results: Generally, population transformation constructs with only a single transgenic drive mechanism have been envisioned. Using a theoretical modelling approach we describe the predicted properties of a construct combining autosomal Medea and underdominant population transformation systems. We show that when combined they can exhibit synergistic properties which in broad circumstances surpass those of the single systems. Conclusion: With combined systems, intentional population transformation and its reversal can be achieved readily. Combined constructs also enhance the capacity to geographically restrict transgenic constructs to targeted populations. It is anticipated that these properties are likely to be of particular value in attracting regulatory approval and public acceptance of this novel technology. © 2014 Gokhale et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

         "One of the key questions in biology is how the metabolism of a cell responds to changes in the environment. In budding yeast, starvation causes a drop in intracellular pH, but the functional role of this pH change is not well understood. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzyme inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between nutritional stress, the metabolism and the physical organization of a cell.",

         "Thrombopoietin (TPO) acting via its receptor, the cellular homologue of the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (Mpl), is the major cytokine regulator of platelet number. To precisely define the role of specific hematopoietic cells in TPO-dependent hematopoiesis, we generated mice that express the Mpl receptor normally on stem/progenitor cells but lack expression on megakaryocytes and platelets (MplPF4cre/PF4cre). Mpl PF4cre/PF4cre mice displayed profound megakaryocytosis and thrombocytosis with a remarkable expansion of megakaryocyte-committed and multipotential progenitor cells, the latter displaying biological responses and a gene expression signature indicative of chronic TPO overstimulation as the underlying causative mechanism, despite a normal circulating TPO level. Thus, TPO signaling in megakaryocytes is dispensable for platelet production; its key role in control of platelet number is via generation and stimulation of the bipotential megakaryocyte precursors. Nevertheless, Mpl expression on megakaryocytes and platelets is essential to prevent megakaryocytosis and myeloproliferation by restricting the amount of TPO available to stimulate the production of megakaryocytes from the progenitor cell pool.",

         "Principal component analysis (PCA) is routinely used to analyze genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, for detecting population structure and potential outliers. However, the size of SNP datasets has increased immensely in recent years and PCA of large datasets has become a time consuming task. We have developed flashpca, a highly efficient PCA implementation based on randomized algorithms, which delivers identical accuracy in extracting the top principal components compared with existing tools, in substantially less time. We demonstrate the utility of flashpca on both HapMap3 and on a large Immunochip dataset. For the latter, flashpca performed PCA of 15,000 individuals up to 125 times faster than existing tools, with identical results, and PCA of 150,000 individuals using flashpca completed in 4 hours. The increasing size of SNP datasets will make tools such as flashpca essential as traditional approaches will not adequately scale. This approach will also help to scale other applications that leverage PCA or eigen-decomposition to substantially larger datasets. © 2014 Abraham, Inouye.",

         "Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, choosing the relevant annotations for interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. I describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic elements that are enriched with or depleted of loci influencing a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. I applied the model to GWASs of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, body mass index, and Crohn disease. For each trait, I used the model to evaluate the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over 100 tissues and cell lines. The fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs influencing protein sequence ranged from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), repressed chromatin was significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits, and cell-type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites were enriched with SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, reweighting each GWAS by using information from functional genomics increased the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5%. © 2014 The American Society of Human Genetics.",

         "Understanding how an organism's nervous system transforms sensory input into behavioral outputs requires recording and manipulating its neural activity during unrestrained behavior. Here we present an instrument to simultaneously monitor and manipulate neural activity while observing behavior in a freely moving animal, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Neural activity is recorded optically from cells expressing a calcium indicator, GCaMP3. Neural activity is manipulated optically by illuminating targeted neurons expressing the optogenetic protein Channelrhodopsin. Real-time computer vision software tracks the animal's behavior and identifies the location of targeted neurons in the nematode as it crawls. Patterned illumination from a DMD is used to selectively illuminate subsets of neurons for either calcium imaging or optogenetic stimulation. Real-time computer vision software constantly updates the illumination pattern in response to the worm's movement and thereby allows for independent optical recording or activation of different neurons in the worm as it moves freely. We use the instrument to directly observe the relationship between sensory neuron activation, interneuron dynamics and locomotion in the worm's mechanosensory circuit. We record and compare calcium transients in the backward locomotion command interneurons AVA, in response to optical activation of the anterior mechanosensory neurons ALM, AVM or both. © 2014 Shipley, Clark, Alkema and Leifer.",

         "Predicting biological structure has remained challenging for systems such as disordered proteins that take on myriad conformations. Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computational model inaccuracies and data uncertainties. Building on recent proposals from maximum entropy theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we address these issues through a Bayesian energy landscape tilting (BELT) scheme for computing Bayesian hyperensembles over conformational ensembles. BELT uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to directly sample maximum-entropy conformational ensembles consistent with a set of input experimental observables. To test this framework, we apply BELT to model trialanine, starting from disagreeing simulations with the force fields ff96, ff99, ff99sbnmr-ildn, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA. BELT incorporation of limited chemical shift and 3J measurements gives convergent values of the peptide's α, β, and PPII conformational populations in all cases. As a test of predictive power, all five BELT hyperensembles recover set-aside measurements not used in the fitting and report accurate errors, even when starting from highly inaccurate simulations. BELT's principled framework thus enables practical predictions for complex biomolecular systems from discordant simulations and sparse data. © 2014 Biophysical Society.",

         "Hybrid zones can be valuable tools for studying evolution and identifying genomic regions responsible for adaptive divergence and underlying phenotypic variation. Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and are maintained by strong selection acting on color pattern. The comimetic species, H. erato and H. melpomene, have parallel hybrid zones in which both species undergo a change from one color pattern form to another. We use restriction-associated DNA sequencing to obtain several thousand genome-wide sequence markers and use these to analyze patterns of population divergence across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two approaches for analysis of this type of data - alignment to a reference genome and de novo assembly - and find that alignment gives the best results for species both closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. erato, ∼15% divergent) related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that the color pattern controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions across the genome, but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to color pattern differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously unmapped color pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus. Finally, we identify a new cryptic population of H. timareta in Ecuador, which occurs at relatively low altitude and is mimetic with H. melpomene malleti. © 2014 Nadeau et al.",

         "Many organisms live in populations structured by space and by class, exhibit plastic responses to their social partners, and are subject to nonadditive ecological and fitness effects. Social evolution theory has long recognized that all of these factors can lead to different selection pressures but has only recently attempted to synthesize how these factors interact. Using models for both discrete and continuous phenotypes, we show that analyzing these factors in a consistent framework reveals that they interact with one another in ways previously overlooked. Specifically, behavioral responses (reciprocity), genetic relatedness, and synergy interact in nontrivial ways that cannot be easily captured by simple summary indices of assortment. We demonstrate the importance of these interactions by showing how they have been neglected in previous synthetic models of social behavior both within and between species. These interactions also affect the level of behavioral responses that can evolve in the long run; proximate biological mechanisms are evolutionarily stable when they generate enough responsiveness relative to the level of responsiveness that exactly balances the ecological costs and benefits. Given the richness of social behavior across taxa, these interactions should be a boon for empirical research as they are likely crucial for describing the complex relationship linking ecology, demography, and social behavior. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",

         "The heritability of a trait (h2) is the proportion of its population variance caused by genetic differences, and estimates of this parameter are important for interpreting the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In recent years, researchers have adopted a novel method for estimating a lower bound on heritability directly from GWAS data that uses realized genetic similarities between nominally unrelated individuals. The quantity estimated by this method is purported to be the contribution to heritability that could in principle be recovered from association studies employing the given panel of SNPs (hSNP2). Thus far, the validity of this approach has mostly been tested empirically. Here, we provide a mathematical explication and show that the method should remain a robust means of obtaining hSNP2 under circumstances wider than those under which it has so far been derived. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",

         "Individuals can manipulate the behavior of social partners. However, manipulation may conflict with the fitness interests of the manipulated individuals. Manipulated individuals can then be favored to resist manipulation, possibly reducing or eliminating the manipulated behavior in the long run. I use a mathematical model to show that conflicts where manipulation and resistance coevolve can disappear as a result of the coevolutionary process. I find that while manipulated individuals are selected to resist, they can simultaneously be favored to express the manipulated behavior at higher efficiency (i.e., providing increasing fitness effects to recipients of the manipulated behavior). Efficiency can increase to a point at which selection for resistance disappears. This process yields an efficient social behavior that is induced by social partners, and over which the inducing and induced individuals are no longer in conflict. A necessary factor is costly inefficiency. I develop the model to address the evolution of advanced eusociality via maternal manipulation (AEMM). The model predicts AEMM to be particularly likely in taxa with ancestrally imperfect resistance to maternal manipulation. Costly inefficiency occurs if the cost of delayed dispersal is larger than the benefit of exploiting the maternal patch. I discuss broader implications of the process. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",

         "Spatial and environmental processes influence species composition at distinct scales. Previous studies suggested that the distribution of larval anurans at the landscape-scale is influenced by environmental gradients related to adult breeding site selection, such as pond canopy cover, but not by water chemistry. However, the combined effects of spatial, pond morphology, and water chemistry variables on metacommunity structure of larval anurans have not been analyzed yet. We used a partial redundancy analysis with variation partitioning to analyze the relative influence of pond morphology (e.g., depth, area, and aquatic vegetation), water chemistry, and spatial variables on a tadpole metacommunity from southeastern Brazil. We predict that pond morphology and canopy cover will influence the metacommunity at broad spatial scales, while water chemistry would play a larger role at finer scales. We found that broad-scale spatial patterns of pond canopy cover and pond morphology strongly influenced metacommunity structure, with water chemistry being not significant. Additionally, species composition was spatially autocorrelated at short distances. We suggest that the reproductive behavior of adult anurans is driving tadpole metacommunity dynamics, since pond morphology, but not water chemistry affects breeding site selection by adults. Our results contribute to the understanding of amphibian species diversity in tropical wetlands. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",

         "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex disease driven by myriad interactions of genetics and environmental factors. Traditionally, studies have analyzed only 1 disease factor at a time, providing useful but limited understanding of the underlying etiology. Recent advances in cost-effective and high-throughput technologies, such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, exome/genome/RNA sequencing, gene expression microarrays, and metabolomics assays have enabled the collection of millions of data points in many thousands of individuals. In order to make sense of such 'omics' data, effective analytical methods are needed. We review and highlight some of the main results in this area, focusing on integrative approaches that consider multiple modalities simultaneously. Such analyses have the potential to uncover the genetic basis of CAD, produce genomic risk scores (GRS) for disease prediction, disentangle the complex interactions underlying disease, and predict response to treatment. © The Author(s) 2014.",

         "Temperature affects both the timing and outcome of animal development, but the detailed effects of temperature on the progress of early development have been poorly characterized. To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5°C and 32.5°C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004293.e003\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"/></inline-formula>33 hours at 17.5°C, and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5°C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D. melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly, develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D. virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration above 22.5°C and have drastically slowed development by 30°C. Despite ranging from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30°C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5°C, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across all species and temperatures examined here, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized timer controlling the progress of embryogenesis that has been tuned by natural selection as each species diverges. © 2014 Kuntz, Eisen.",

         "Normal mode analysis (NMA) methods are widely used to study dynamic aspects of protein structures. Two critical components of NMA methods are coarse-graining in the level of simplification used to represent protein structures and the choice of potential energy functional form. There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy in different choices. In one extreme one finds accurate but slow molecular-dynamics based methods with all-atom representations and detailed atom potentials. On the other extreme, fast elastic network model (ENM) methods with Cα-only representations and simplified potentials that based on geometry alone, thus oblivious to protein sequence. Here we present ENCoM, an Elastic Network Contact Model that employs a potential energy function that includes a pairwise atom-type non-bonded interaction term and thus makes it possible to consider the effect of the specific nature of amino-acids on dynamics within the context of NMA. ENCoM is as fast as existing ENM methods and outperforms such methods in the generation of conformational ensembles. Here we introduce a new application for NMA methods with the use of ENCoM in the prediction of the effect of mutations on protein stability. While existing methods are based on machine learning or enthalpic considerations, the use of ENCoM, based on vibrational normal modes, is based on entropic considerations. This represents a novel area of application for NMA methods and a novel approach for the prediction of the effect of mutations. We compare ENCoM to a large number of methods in terms of accuracy and self-consistency. We show that the accuracy of ENCoM is comparable to that of the best existing methods. We show that existing methods are biased towards the prediction of destabilizing mutations and that ENCoM is less biased at predicting stabilizing mutations. © 2014 Frappier, Najmanovich.",

         "With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, many large scale experimental efforts aim to map genotypic variability among individuals. This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes, ranging from evolutionary adaptation and speciation to the spread of genetic diseases and drug resistance. An interesting and important component of this variability is present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability, gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the fold-change in gene expression. The model combines single-base pair resolution maps of transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding energies with a comprehensive thermodynamic model of gene regulation. The model was validated by predicting and then measuring the variability of lac operon regulation in a collection of natural isolates. We then implement the model to analyze the sensitivity of the promoter sequence to the regulatory output, and predict the potential for regulation to evolve due to point mutations in the promoter region. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

         "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common form of inherited mental retardation, is caused by a loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is involved in brain functions by interacting with mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that selectively control gene expression at translational level. However, little is known about the role of FMRP in regulating miRNA expression. Here, we found a development-dependant dynamic expression of Fmr1 gene (encoding FMRP) in mouse hippocampus with a small peak at postnatal day 7 (P7). MiRNA microarray analysis showed that the levels of 38 miRNAs showed a significant increase with about 15 ~ 250-folds and the levels of 26 miRNAs showed a significant decrease with only about 2 ~ 4-folds in the hippocampus of P7 Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. The qRT-PCR assay showed that nine of the most increased miRNAs (>100-folds in microarrays) increased about 40 ~ 70-folds and their pre-miRNAs increased about 5 ~ 10-folds, but no significant difference in their pri-miRNA levels was observed, suggesting that the alterations of partial miRNAs are an indirect consequence of FMRP lacking. We further demonstrated that a set of protein-coding mRNAs, potentially targeted by the nine miRNAs, were down-regulated in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-34b, miR-340, and miR-148a could down-regulate the reporter gene expression by interacting with the Met 3′ UTR. Taken together, these findings suggest that the miRNA expression alterations resulted from the absence of FMRP might contribute to molecular pathology of FXS.",

         "As a field, synthetic biology strives to engineer increasingly complex artificial systems in living cells. Active feedback in closed loop systems offers a dynamic and adaptive way to ensure constant relative activity independent of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. In this work, we use synthetic protein scaffolds as a modular and tunable mechanism for concentration tracking through negative feedback. Input to the circuit initiates scaffold production, leading to colocalization of a two-component system and resulting in the production of an inhibitory antiscaffold protein. Using a combination of modeling and experimental work, we show that the biomolecular concentration tracker circuit achieves dynamic protein concentration tracking in Escherichia coli and that steady state outputs can be tuned.",

         "['A proteins genetic architecture - the set of causal rules by which its sequence produces its functions - also determines its possible evolutionary trajectories. Prior research has proposed that genetic architecture of proteins is very complex, with pervasive epistatic interactions that constrain evolution and make function difficult to predict from sequence. Most of this work has analyzed only the direct paths between two proteins of interest - excluding the vast majority of possible genotypes and evolutionary trajectories - and has considered only a single protein function, leaving unaddressed the genetic architecture of functional specificity and its impact on the evolution of new functions. Here we develop a new method based on ordinal logistic regression to directly characterize the global genetic determinants of multiple protein functions from 20-state combinatorial deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. We use it to dissect the genetic architecture and evolution of a transcription factors specificity for DNA, using data from a combinatorial DMS of an ancient steroid hormone receptors capacity to activate transcription from two biologically relevant DNA elements. We show that the genetic architecture of DNA recognition consists of a dense set of main and pairwise effects that involve virtually every possible amino acid state in the protein-DNA interface, but higher-order epistasis plays only a tiny role. Pairwise interactions enlarge the set of functional sequences and are the primary determinants of specificity for different DNA elements. They also massively expand the number of opportunities for single-residue mutations to switch specificity from one DNA target to another. By bringing variants with different functions close together in sequence space, pairwise epistasis therefore facilitates rather than constrains the evolution of new functions.', 'Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce alternative phenotypes in response to its environment of development, is an important mechanism for coping with variable environments. While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low - but significant - effect of strain x environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.', 'Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow in a myriad of experimental conditions such that researchers have the ability to investigate any number of genotypes, strains, environments, or the interaction thereof. However, studies of variation in the yeast transcriptome have been limited by the processing capabilities of available RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform for yeasts. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage \"the awesome power of yeast\" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time, and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since we use the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique samples in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here we report transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, growth rate, metabolic strategies, stress responses, etc. all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.']"

         "['Decoding of brain tasks aims to identify individuals brain states and brain fingerprints to predict behavior. Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions. We hypothesized that ToM network brain connectivity could predict individual performance on false-belief tasks. We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']"

The accurate determination of binding affinities, essential for decoding PPIs, faces challenges due to the substantial time and financial costs involved in experimental and theoretical methods. This situation underscores the urgent need for more effective and precise methodologies for predicting binding affinity. Despite the abundance of research on PPI modeling, the field of quantitative binding affinity prediction remains underexplored, mainly due to a lack of comprehensive data.\\n\\nThis study seeks to address these needs by manually curating pairwise interaction labels on all available 3D structures of proteins complexes, with experimentally determined binding affinities, creating the largest dataset for structure-based pairwise protein interaction with binding affinity to date. Subsequently, we introduce \"ProAffinity-GNN\", a novel deep learning framework using protein language model and graph neural network (GNN) to improve the accuracy of prediction of structure-based protein-protein binding affinities. The evaluation results across several benchmark test sets demonstrate that ProAffinity-GNN not only outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy but also shows strong generalization capabilities.', 'Protein-RNA interactions play a critical role in many cellular processes and pathologies. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and {pi}-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are due to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer belong to the interface in the interolog, a phenomenon we term \"interface switching out\". We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarii of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.', 'Protein therapeutics play an important role in controlling the functions and activities of disease-causing proteins in modern medicine. Despite protein therapeutics having several advantages over traditional small-molecule therapeutics, further development has been hindered by drug complexity and delivery issues. However, recent progress in deep learning-based protein structure prediction approaches such as AlphaFold opens new opportunities to exploit the complexity of these macro-biomolecules for highly-specialised design to inhibit, regulate or even manipulate specific disease-causing proteins. Anti-CRISPR proteins are small proteins from bacteriophages that counter-defend against the prokaryotic adaptive immunity of CRISPR-Cas systems. They are unique examples of natural protein therapeutics that have been optimized by the host-parasite evolutionary arms race to inhibit a wide variety of host proteins. Here, we show that these Anti-CRISPR proteins display diverse inhibition mechanisms through accurate structural prediction and functional analysis. We find that these phage-derived proteins are extremely distinct in structure, some of which have no homologues in the current protein structure domain. Furthermore, we find a novel family of Anti-CRISPR proteins which are structurally homologous to the recently-discovered mechanism of manipulating host proteins through enzymatic activity, rather than through direct inference. Using highly accurate structure prediction, we present a wide variety of protein-manipulating strategies of anti-CRISPR proteins for future protein drug design.']"

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors. The datasets, analyses, and tools presented here will enable the generation of testable hypotheses about the cell and organ-specific function of genes in diverse biological contexts.', 'Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.']"

Understanding the links between traits and fitness is therefore critical for predicting how populations and communities respond to environmental change. However, the net effects of traits on species fitness are largely unknown because we have lacked a framework for estimating fitness across multiple species and environments.\\nC_LIO_LIWe present a modeling framework that integrates trait effects on demographic performance over the life cycles of individuals to estimate the net effect of traits on species fitness. This approach involves 1) modeling trait effects on individual demographic rates (growth, survival, and recruitment) as multidimensional performance surfaces that vary with individual size and environment and 2) integrating these effects into a population model to project population growth rates (i.e., fitness) as a function of traits and environment. We illustrate our approach by estimating performance surfaces and fitness landscapes for trees across a temperature gradient in the eastern United States.\\nC_LIO_LIFunctional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, and maximum height) interacted with individual size and temperature to influence tree growth, survival, and recruitment rates, generating demographic trade-offs and shaping the contours of fitness landscapes. Tall tree species had high survival, growth, and fitness across the temperature gradient. Wood density and specific leaf area had interactive effects on demographic performance, resulting in fitness landscapes with multiple peaks.\\nC_LIO_LIWith this approach it is now possible to empirically estimate the net effect of traits on fitness, leading to improved understanding of the selective forces that drive community assembly and permitting generalizable predictions of population and community dynamics in changing environments.\\nC_LI', 'Climates are changing rapidly, demanding equally rapid adaptation of natural populations. Whether sexual selection can aid such adaptation is under debate; while sexual selection should promote adaptation when individuals with high mating success are also best adapted to their local surroundings, the expression of sexually selected traits can incur costs. Here we asked what the demographic consequences of such costs may be once climates change to become harsher and the strength of natural selection increases. We investigated how an evolutionary history of strong postcopulatory sexual selection (sperm competition) affects male fertility under acute adult heat stress. Harnessing the empirical potential of long-term experimental evolution in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we assessed the thermal sensitivity of fertility (TSF) in replicated lines maintained for 68 generations under three alternative mating regimes manipulating the opportunity for sexual and natural selection. We find that males evolving under strong sexual selection suffer from increased TSF, and that male success in sperm competition (P2: sperm offense) is genetically correlated to increased TSF. Interestingly, females from the regime under strong sexual selection, who experienced relaxed selection on their own reproductive effort, had high fertility in benign settings but suffered increased TSF, like their brothers. This implies that female fertility and TSF evolved through genetic correlation with reproductive traits sexually selected in males. Paternal but not maternal heat stress reduced offspring fertility with no evidence for adaptive transgenerational plasticity among heat-exposed offspring, indicating that the observed effects may compound over generations. Our results suggest that trade-offs between fertility and traits increasing success in postcopulatory sexual selection can be revealed in harsh environments. This can put polyandrous species under increased risk during extreme heat waves expected under future climate change.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTHow will populations respond to a warming world? Of increasing concern are negative effects of elevated temperatures on fertility, which in many species are observed for temperatures substantially lower than the ones causing death. Incorporating knowledge on species-specific thermal fertility limits has improved estimates of current species ranges but renders a more pessimistic view of the potential for adaptive responses under climate change. Sexual selection is a process that can interact with thermal sensitivity of fertility and is strongest in males of polyandrous species, in which females mate multiply and sperm of multiple males compete for fertilization of female eggs. Therefore, males of polyandrous species often invest heavily in sperm competition. However, given finite resources, increased investment in sperm competition can come at an expense of other processes needed to maintain the integrity of the male germline, which when compromised can reduce fertility and offspring quality. How may such male investment, fuelled by sexual selection, affect species responses to climate warming? To address this question, we first evolved populations under different laboratory settings that independently manipulated the levels of natural and sexual selection. We exposed adults from these populations to acute heat stress and measured the fertility of males and females. We find that sexual selection on males leads to a fertility debt that is revealed under heat stress. This debt was also apparent in females, who themselves were not selected for increased reproductive investment. Thus, genes under sexual selection in males seems to have impaired fertility in both sexes under heat stress. Forecasts of species response to climate change that do not incorporate thermal fertility limits and sexual selection may therefore underestimate species vulnerability to increasing temperatures.', 'Abiotic environmental conditions play a key role in driving the size and shape of organisms. Quantifying environment-morphology relationships is important not only for understanding the fundamental processes driving phenotypic diversity within and among species (1), but also for predicting how species will respond to ongoing global change (2). Despite a clear set of expectations motivated by ecological theory (3), broad evidence in support of generalizable effects of abiotic conditions, such as temperature (4), on spatial and temporal intraspecific morphological variation has been limited. Using standardized data from over 250,000 captures of 105 landbird species, we assessed intraspecific shifts in bird morphology since 1989 while simultaneously measuring spatial morphological gradients across the North American continent. Across bird species, we found strong spatial and temporal trends in body size, with warmer temperatures associated with smaller body sizes both at more equatorial latitudes and in more recent years. The magnitude of these thermal effects varied both across and within species, with results suggesting it is the warmest, rather than the coldest, temperatures driving both spatial and temporal trends. Across elevation, we found that body size declines as relative wing length increases, likely due to the benefits that longer wings confer for flight in thin air environments. Our results provide support for both existing and new large-scale ecomorphological gradients and highlight how the response of functional tradeoffs to abiotic variation drives morphological change.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCharacterizing how the size and shape of organisms varies over space and time is key to understanding the processes that create ecological communities and for predicting how species will respond to climate change. Across more than 100 species of North American birds, we show that within species the size and shape of individuals varies substantially across space and time. Warmer temperatures are associated with smaller body sizes, likely due to the importance of body size for thermoregulation. As the climate continues to warm, these species will likely continue to shrink. We also provide the first large-scale evidence of an increase in wing length with elevation, a pattern that could be attributed to thinner air in high elevation environments.']"

However, due to technical limitations, it remains unclear how MuSCs dynamically interact with non-myogenic cells, especially myeloid cells, in live animals. In this work, we developed a dual-laser multimodal nonlinear optical microscope platform to serve as an effective tool for studying the real-time interaction between MuSCs and non-myogenic cells during the early phase of muscle regeneration. Increased cell volume and mitochondrial mass, cell density, and myotube formation are indicative of MuSCs activation/growth, proliferation, and differentiation, respectively. Using 3D time-lapse imaging on live reporter mice containing both red fluorescence protein (RFP)-labeled macrophages and yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-labeled MuSCs, and taking advantages of the autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), we monitored the real-time spatiotemporal interaction between RFP+ macrophages/RFP- non-myogenic cells and YFP+ muscle stem/progenitor cells during the activation and the proliferation stages of regeneration. Our results indicated that their cell-cell contact was transient in nature. By inhibiting macrophage infiltration, we further showed that direct cell-cell contact between macrophages and MuSCs was not required for early activation of MuSCs before the proliferation stage. However, decreased macrophage infiltration impeded the proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs and also led to intramuscular fibrosis. Besides, neutrophil depletion in the CCR2 deficient mice did not delay the initial growth of MuSCs. These findings provide a new perspective on myeloid cells role during muscle regeneration.', 'Cardiomyocytes undergo different metabolic changes during development and differentiation crucial for their maturation and adult function, such as contraction, growth and survival. Alterations of cardiac metabolism have been associated with multiple disease states and pathological hypertrophy. The shift in substrate preference can impair the stress response, but it may also have a role in cell growth and survival. Here, we evaluated the response of cardiomyocytes to the presence of exogenous lactate, an important metabolite for the fetal heart and cardiogenesis. Lactate-exposed mouse primary cardiomyocytes and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes quickly acquired a characteristic dedifferentiated phenotype, with enhanced proliferative capacity as determined by an increased expression of cell cycle (Ki67) and cytokinesis (Aurora-B) effectors. This effect was specific to cardiomyocytes and did not affect other heart cell populations (e.g. cardiac fibroblasts). Nevertheless, cardiac fibroblasts exposed to lactate promoted a pro-regenerative environment through the modulation of the release of cytokines (such as Fas, IL-13 or SDF1a). We characterized lactate-induced cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation through RNA-sequencing and gene expression analysis and identified increased expression of BMP10 (a TGF{beta} family protein involved in embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and stemness) and proteins associated to cell fate regulation (LIN28, TCIM) together with downregulation of cardiac maturation genes (GRIK1, DGKK). Bottom-up analysis suggested the phenotype promoted by lactate could be related to the activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. This finding indicated that, indeed, lactate may be a key player of hypoxic regenerative responses in the heart, as it usually accumulates as a result of glycolysis. In addition, ex vivo neonatal heart culture showed prolonged beating function and cardiac tissue integrity when culture media was supplemented with lactate. Thus, we conclude that lactate enhances cardiac proliferation by reprogramming cardiomyocytes towards a dedifferentiated stem cell-like state, supporting the notion that modulation of the metabolic microenvironment might be a powerful novel approach for promoting cardiac regeneration and tissue engineering applications.', 'Increased body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying basis of these associations are unclear. In order to assess this, we studied how IR and associated inflammation in adipose tissue developed in the presence of increased body iron stores. Male hepcidin knock-out (Hamp1-/-) mice, which have increased body iron stores, and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 and 24 weeks. Development of IR and metabolic parameters linked to this, insulin signaling in tissue, and inflammation and iron-related parameters in visceral adipose tissue were studied in these animals. HFD-feeding resulted in impaired glucose tolerance in both genotypes of mice. In response to the HFD for 24 weeks, Hamp1-/- mice gained less body weight and developed less IR than corresponding WT mice. This was associated with less lipid accumulation in the liver and decreased inflammation and lipolysis in the adipose tissue in the knock-out mice, than in the WT animals. Fewer macrophages infiltrated the adipose tissue in the knockout mice than in wild-type mice, with these macrophages exhibiting a predominantly anti-inflammatory (M2-like) phenotype. These observations suggest a novel role of hepcidin (central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis) in the development of inflammation in adipose tissue and insulin resistance, in response to a high-fat diet.\\n\\nCLINICAL PERSPECTIVESO_LIElevated body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

However, it remains unclear how heritable the microbiome is with respect to the host plant genotype and to what extent host genetic mechanisms can modulate plant-microbe interactions in the face of environmental stress. Here, we surveyed the root and rhizosphere microbiome of 129 accessions of locally adapted Zea mays, sourced from diverse habitats and grown under control and different stress conditions. We quantified treatment and host genotype effects on the microbiome. Plant genotype and source environment were predictive of microbiome composition. Genome wide association analysis identified host genetic variants linked to both rhizosphere microbiome composition and source environment. We identified transposon insertions in a candidate gene linked to both the abundance of a keystone microbe Massilia and source total soil nitrogen, finding mutant plants to show a reduction in lateral root density. We conclude that locally adapted maize varieties exert patterns of genetic control on their root and rhizosphere microbiomes that follow variation in their home environments, consistent with a role in tolerance to prevailing stress.', 'Associations with soil microorganisms are crucial for plants overall health and functioning. While much work has been done to understand drivers of rhizosphere microbiome structure and function, the relative importance of geography, climate, soil properties, and plant genetics remains unclear, as results have been mixed and comprehensive studies across many sites and genotypes are limited. Rhizosphere microbiomes are crucial for crop resistance to pathogens, stress tolerance, nutrient availability, and ultimately yield. Here we quantify the relative roles of plant genotype, environment, and their interaction in shaping soil rhizosphere communities, using 16S and ITS gene sequencing of rhizosphere soils from 10 common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genotypes from 15 sites across the Great Plains of the United States. While site generally outweighed genotype overall in terms of effects on archaeal, bacterial and fungal richness, community composition, and taxa relative abundances, there was also a significant interaction such that genotype exerted a significant influence on archaeal, bacterial and fungal microbiomes in certain sites. Site effects were attributed to a combination of spatial distance and differences in climate and soil properties. Microbial taxa that were previously associated with resistance to the fungal necrotrophic pathogen Sclerotinia were present in most sites but differed significantly in relative abundance across sites. Our results have implications for plant breeding and agronomic microbiome manipulations for agricultural improvement across different geographic regions.\\n\\nImportanceDespite the importance of plant breeding in agriculture, we still have a limited understanding of how plant genetic variation shapes soil microbiome composition across broad geographic regions. Using 15 sites across the Great Plains of North America, we show that cultivated sunflower rhizosphere archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities are driven primarily by site soil and climatic differences, but that genotype can interact with site to influence composition, especially in warmer and drier sites with lower overall microbial richness. We also show that all taxa that were previously found to be associated with resistance to the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were widespread but significantly affected by site, while a subset were also significantly affected by genotype. Our results contribute to a broader understanding of rhizosphere archaeal, bacterial and fungal community assembly, and provide foundational knowledge for plant breeding efforts and potential future microbiome manipulations in agriculture.', 'Plant secondary metabolites that are released into the rhizosphere alter biotic and abiotic soil properties, which in turn affect the performance of other plants. How such plant-soil feedbacks affect agricultural productivity and food quality in crop rotations is unknown. Here, we assessed the impact of maize benzoxazinoids on the performance, yield and food quality of three winter wheat varieties in a two-year field experiment. Following maize cultivation, we detected benzoxazinoid-dependent chemical and microbial fingerprints in the soil. The chemical fingerprint was still visible during wheat growth, while the microbial fingerprint was no longer detected. Benzoxazinoid soil conditioning by wild-type maize led to increased wheat emergence, tillering, growth and biomass compared to soil conditioning by bx1 mutant plants. Weed cover remained unaffected, while insect damage decreased in a subset of varieties. Wheat yield was increased by over 4% without a reduction in grain quality across varieties. This improvement was directly associated with increased germination and tillering. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that plant secondary metabolites can increase yield via plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions. If this phenomenon holds across different soils and environmental conditions, optimizing plant root exudation could be a powerful, genetically tractable strategy to enhance crop yields without additional inputs.']"

Although tremendous efforts have been put into investigating the pathogeny of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host is largely unexplored. Here, by comparing the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and human, we identified five fully conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were termed as \"human identical sequences (HIS)\". HIS are also recognized in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Meanwhile, HIS-SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved in the primate. Mechanically, HIS-SARS-CoV-2, behaving as virus-derived miRNAs, directly target to the human genomic loci and further interact with host enhancers to activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokines gene and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), a well-known cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which further increases hyaluronan formation. Noteworthily, hyaluronan level in plasma of COVID-19 patients is tightly correlated with severity and high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may act as a predictor for the progression of COVID-19. HIS antagomirs, which downregulate hyaluronan level effectively, and 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, are potential drugs to relieve the ARDS related ground-glass pattern in lung for COVID-19 treatment. Our results revealed that unprecedented HIS elements of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Thus, blocking HIS-involved activating processes or hyaluronan synthesis directly by 4-MU may be effective strategies to alleviate COVID-19 progression.', 'SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has caused an unprecedented global health crisis. The SARS-CoV-2 spike, a surface-anchored trimeric class-I fusion-glycoprotein essential for viral entry, represents a key target for developing vaccines and therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-variants that facilitate virus spread and may affect vaccine efficacy highlights the need to identify novel antiviral strategies for COVID-19 therapy. Here we demonstrate that nitazoxanide, an antiprotozoal agent with recognized broad-spectrum antiviral activity, interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis, hampering its maturation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage. Engineering multiple SARS-CoV-2 variant-pseudoviruses and utilizing quantitative cell-cell fusion assays, we show that nitazoxanide-induced spike modifications hinder progeny virion infectivity as well as spike-driven pulmonary cell-cell fusion, a critical feature of COVID-19 pathology. Nitazoxanide, being equally effective against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-spike and different emerging variants, including the Delta variant of concern, may represent a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19 infections.', 'SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by remarkable differences, including contagiosity and case fatality rate. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, illustrating major knowledge gaps of coronavirus biology. In this study, protein expression of SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 was analysed using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS). This resulted in the so far most comprehensive map of infection-related proteome-wide expression changes in human cells covering the quantification of 7478 proteins across 4 time points. Most notably, the activation of interferon type-I response was observed, which surprisingly is absent in other recent proteome studies, but is known to occur in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 triggers interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression much stronger than SARS-CoV, which reflects the already described differences in interferon sensitivity. Potentially, this may be caused by the enhanced expression of viral M protein of SARS-CoV in comparison to SARS-CoV-2, which is a known inhibitor of type I interferon expression. This study expands the knowledge on the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infections on a global scale using an infection model, which seems to be well suited to analyse innate immunity.']"

The objective of our study is to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of vector mosquito species in Maricopa County, AZ from 2011 to 2021, and to identify the hotspot areas for West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis Encephalitis virus (SLEV) transmission in 2021. The Maricopa County Mosquito Control surveillance system utilizes BG-Sentinel and EVS-CDC traps throughout the entire urban and suburban areas of the county. We estimated specific mosquito species relative abundance per unit area using the Kernel density estimator in ArcGIS 10.2. We calculated the distance between all traps in the surveillance system and created a 4 km buffer radius around each trap to calculate the extent to which each trap deviated from the mean number of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis collected in 2021. Our results show that vector mosquito species are widely distributed and abundant in the urban areas of Maricopa County. A total of 691,170 Culex quinquefasciatus, 542,733 Culex tarsalis, and 292,305 Aedes aegypti were collected from 2011 to 2022. The relative abundance of Ae. aegypti was highly seasonal peaking in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Culex quinquefasciatus, on the other hand, was abundant throughout the year with several regions consistently yielding high numbers of mosquitoes. Culex tarsalis was abundant but it only reached high numbers in well-defined areas bordering natural and rural areas. We also detected high levels of heterogeneity in the risk of WNV and SLEV transmission to humans disregarding traps geographical proximity. The well-defined species-specific spatiotemporal and geographical patterns found in this study can be used to inform vector control operations.', 'Mosquitoes harbor a large diversity of eukaryotic viruses. Those viromes probably influence mosquito physiology and the transmission of human pathogens. Nevertheless, their ecology remains largely unstudied. Here, we address two key questions in virome ecology. First, we assessed the influence of mosquito species on virome taxonomic diversity and relative abundance. Contrary to most previous studies, the potential effect of the habitat was explicitly included. Thousands of individuals of Culex poicilipes and Culex tritaeniorhynchus, two vectors of viral diseases, were concomitantly sampled in three habitats over two years. A total of 95 viral taxa from 25 families were identified with meta-transcriptomics, with 75% of taxa shared by both mosquitoes. Viromes significantly differed by mosquito species but not by habitat. Differences were largely due to changes in relative abundance of shared taxa. Then, we studied the diversity of viruses with a broad host range. We searched for viral taxa shared by the two Culex species and Aedes vexans, another disease vector, present in one of the habitats. Twenty-six out of the 163 viral taxa were found in the three mosquitoes. These taxa encompassed 14 families. A database analysis supported broad host ranges for many of those viruses, as well as a widespread geographical distribution. Thus, the viromes of mosquitoes from the same genera mainly differed in the relative abundance of shared taxa, whereas differences in viral diversity dominated between mosquito genera. Whether this new model of virome diversity and structure applies to other mosquito communities remains to be determined.', 'Dengue viruses (DENV) are expanding global pathogens that are transmitted through the bite of mosquitoes, mostly Aedes aegypti. As RNA viruses, DENV rely on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to complete their life cycle. Alternatively, RBPs can act as restriction factors that prevent DENV multiplication. While the importance of RBPs is well-supported in humans, there is a dearth of information about their influence on DENV transmission by mosquitoes. Such knowledge could be harnessed to design novel, effective interventions against DENV. Here, we successfully adapted RNA-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry - a technique initially developed in mammalian cells - to identify RBPs in Ae. aegypti cells. We identified fourteen RBPs interacting with DENV serotype 2 3UTR, which is involved in the viral multiplication and produces subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA). We validated the RNA affinity results for two RBPs by confirming that AePur binds the 3UTR, whereas AeStaufen interacts with both 3UTR and sfRNA. Using in vivo functional evaluation, we determined that RBPs like AeRan, AeExoRNase, and AeRNase have pro-viral functions, whereas AeGTPase, AeAtu, and AePur have anti-viral functions in mosquitoes. Furthermore, we showed that human and mosquito Pur homologs have a shared affinity to DENV2 RNA, although the anti-viral effect is specific to the mosquito protein. Importantly, we revealed that AeStaufen mediates a reduction of gRNA and sfRNA copies in several mosquito tissues, including the salivary glands and that AeStaufen-mediated sfRNA reduction diminishes the concentration of transmission-enhancing sfRNA in saliva, thereby revealing AeStaufens role in DENV transmission. By characterizing the first RBPs that bind to DENV2 3UTR in mosquitoes, our study unravels new pro- and anti-viral targets for the design of novel therapeutic interventions as well as provides foundation for studying the role of RBPs in virus-vector interactions.\\n\\nAuthor abstractDengue viruses are important human pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes. Currently, there are no effective control measures for dengue. The RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in mosquitoes, which bind to the dengue virus genome to regulate viral multiplication, could serve as new targets for developing therapeutic interventions. In this study, we pioneered the use of RNA-affinity chromatography - a technique that identifies proteins binding to specific RNA sequences - in mosquito cells. This led to the detection of fourteen RBPs that bind to the 3UTR of dengue virus serotype 2. We validated our results using immunoprecipitation method. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 6 of the 14 RBPs influence viral multiplication in mosquitoes. Among these six RBPs, we showed that the AePur mosquito and human homologs share an affinity to dengue virus RNA, whereas the anti-viral function is specific to the mosquito homolog. Importantly, we revealed that AeStaufen mediates a reduction of genomic and subgenomic flaviviral RNAs in multiple mosquito tissues. We also showed that the reduction of subgenomic flaviviral RNA in salivary glands diminishes the secretion of salivary subgenomic RNA, which facilitates infection at the bite site, thereby unveiling the function of AeStaufen in the virus transmission. By characterizing the first mosquito RBPs that bind to dengue virus genome, our study paves the way for leveraging these proteins as potential targets to block virus transmission.']"

However, the impact of radiation on the microbiota in the murine bone marrow transplantation model is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present the major conclusions of our investigation into the effects of radiation and subsequent bone marrow transplantation with or without T cell depletion of the donor bone-marrow on the microbiota of the ileum and cecum. Our findings show that radiation has different effects on the microbiota of the two intestinal regions, with the cecum showing increased interindividual variation, suggesting an impaired ability of the host to regulate microbial symbionts, consistent with the Anna Karenina principle. Additionally, we observed changes in the ileum composition, including an increase in bacterial taxa that are important modulators of host health, such as Akkermansia and Faecalibaculum.\\n\\nIn contrast, radiation in the cecum was associated with an increased abundance of several common commensal taxa in the gut, including Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroides. Finally, we found that high doses of radiation had more substantial effects on the caecal microbiota of the T-cell-depleted group than that of the non-T-cell-depleted group. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between radiation and the gut microbiota in the context of bone marrow transplantation and highlight the importance of considering different intestinal regions when studying microbiome responses to environmental stressors.', 'Susceptibility to Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) typically follows the administration of antibiotics. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have increased incidence of CDI, even in the absence of antibiotic treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying this susceptibility are not well understood. To explore the intersection between CDI and IBD, we recently described a mouse model where colitis triggered by the murine gut bacterium, Helicobacter hepaticus, in IL-10-/- mice led to susceptibility to C. difficile colonization without antibiotic administration. The current work disentangles the relative contributions of inflammation and gut microbiota in colonization resistance to C. difficile in this model. We show that inflammation drives changes in microbiota composition, which leads to CDI susceptibility. Decreasing inflammation with an anti-p40 monoclonal antibody promotes a shift of the microbiota back toward a colonization-resistant state. Transferring microbiota from susceptible and resistant mice to germ-free animals transfers the susceptibility phenotype, supporting the primacy of the microbiota in colonization resistance. These findings shine light on the complex interactions between the host, microbiota, and C. difficile in the context of intestinal inflammation, and may form a basis for the development of strategies to prevent or treat CDI in IBD patients.\\n\\nImportancePatients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing C. difficile infection (CDI), even in the absence of antibiotic treatment. Yet, mechanisms regulating C. difficile colonization in IBD patients remain unclear. Here, we use an antibiotic-independent mouse model to demonstrate that intestinal inflammation alters microbiota composition to permit C. difficile colonization in mice with colitis. Notably, treating inflammation with an anti-p40 monoclonal antibody, a clinically relevant IBD therapeutic, restores microbiota-mediated colonization resistance to the pathogen. Through microbiota transfer experiments in germ-free mice, we confirm that the microbiota shaped in the setting of IBD is the primary driver of susceptibility to C. diffiicile colonization. Collectively, our findings provide insight into CDI pathogenesis in the context of intestinal inflammation, which may inform methods to manage infection in IBD patients. More broadly, this work advances our understanding of mechanisms by which the host-microbiota interface modulates colonization resistance to C. difficile.', 'The gut microbiota is in continuous interaction with the intestinal mucosa via metabolic, neuro- immunological, and neuroendocrine pathways. Disruption in levels of antimicrobial peptides produced by the enteroendocrine cells, such as catestatin, has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota and imbalance in intestinal homeostasis. However, whether the changes in the gut microbiota have a causational role in intestinal dyshomeostasis has remained elusive. To this end, we performed reciprocal fecal microbial transplantation in wild-type mice and mice with a knockout in the catestatin coding region of the chromogranin-A gene (CST-KO mice). Combined microbiota phylogenetic profiling, RNA sequencing, and transmission electron microscopy were employed. Fecal microbiota transplantation from mice deficient in catestatin (CST-KO) to microbiota-depleted wild-type mice induced transcriptional and physiological features characteristic of a distorted colon in the recipient animals, including impairment in tight junctions, as well as an increased collagen area fraction indicating colonic fibrosis. In contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation from wild-type mice to microbiota-depleted CST-KO mice reduced collagen fibrotic area, restored disrupted tight junction morphology, and altered fatty acid metabolism in recipient CST-KO mice. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the murine metabolic- and immune-related cellular pathways and processes that are co-mediated by the fecal microbiota transplantation and supports a prominent role for the gut microbiota in the colonic distortion associated with the lack of catestatin in mice. Overall, the data show that the gut microbiota may play a causal role in the development of features of intestinal inflammation and metabolic disorders, known to be associated with altered levels of catestatin and may, thus, provide a tractable target in the treatment and prevention of these disorders.']"

A deeper understanding of how an antibiotics mechanism of action influences the emergence of resistance would aid in the design of new drugs and help to preserve the effectiveness of existing ones. To this end, we developed a model that links bacterial population dynamics with antibiotic-target binding kinetics. Our approach allows us to derive mechanistic insights on drug activity from population-scale experimental data and to quantify the interplay between drug mechanism and resistance selection. We find that whether a drug acts as a bacteriostatic or bactericidal agent has little influence on resistance selection. We also show that heterogeneous drug-target binding within a population enables resistant bacteria to evolve fitness-improving secondary mutations even when drug doses remain above the resistant strains minimum inhibitory concentration. Our work suggests that antibiotic doses beyond this \"secondary mutation selection window\" could safeguard against the emergence of high-fitness resistant strains during treatment.', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a medically important bacteria due to its ability to form biofilm and is also an opportunistic pathogen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the intrinsic ability to form biofilm as one of the defense mechanisms for their survival. The fact that it can form biofilms on various medical implants makes it more harmful clinically. Although various antibiotics are used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, previous studies have shown that sub-MIC levels of antibiotics cause biofilm formation in this type of bacteria. The present study thus deals with the effect of the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin on the biofilm dynamics of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3. Biofilm formation was seen to be increasing with increased gentamicin concentrations in growth media. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy accompanied with other biochemical tests deduced that biofilm-forming components like exoproteins, eDNA, and exolipids as exopolymeric substances in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were increased in the presence of gentamicin. An increase in reactive oxygen species generation along with increased cell surface hydrophobicity was also seen in both strains when treated with gentamicin. The observed increase in the adherence of the cells accompanied by an increase in exopolymeric substances, eDNA, and exolipids may have largely contributed to the increased biofilm production by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3 under the stress of the antibiotic treatment.', 'Pathogenic fungi are a cause of growing concern. Developing an efficient and safe antifungal is challenging because of the similar biological properties of fungal and host cells. Consequently, there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms underlying antifungal resistance to prolong the efficacy of current molecules. A major step in this direction would be to be able to predict or even prevent the acquisition of resistance. We leverage the power of experimental evolution to quantify the diversity of paths to resistance to the antifungal 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), commercially known as flucytosine. We generated hundreds of independent 5-FC resistant mutants derived from two genetic backgrounds from wild isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through automated pin-spotting, whole-genome and amplicon sequencing, we identified the most likely causes of resistance for most strains. Approximately a third of all resistant mutants evolved resistance through a pleiotropic drug response, a potentially novel mechanism in response to 5-FC, marked by cross-resistance to fluconazole. These cross-resistant mutants are characterized by a loss of respiration and a strong tradeoff in drug-free media. For the majority of the remaining two thirds, resistance was acquired through loss-of-function mutations in FUR1, which encodes an important enzyme in the metabolism of 5-FC. We describe conditions in which mutations affecting this particular step of the metabolic pathway are favored over known resistance mutations affecting a step upstream, such as the well-known target cytosine deaminase encoded by FCY1. This observation suggests that ecological interactions may dictate the identity of resistance hotspots.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDetermining the paths evolution takes to make microbes resistant to antimicrobials is key to drug stewardship. Flucytosine is one of the oldest antifungals available. It is often used to treat cryptococcal infections. However, despite decades of use in the clinic, some details of its metabolism and of the mechanisms of resistance evolution still elude us. Flucytosine resistance is most often acquired specifically by inactivating a gene essential for the activation of this prodrug. We show that among many paths possible, one is overrepresented and involves a diversity of mutations that prevent enzyme expression or its activity. This path is preferred because these mutations also protect from the activation of the prodrug by non-mutant cells. A second, less frequent path to resistance, putatively involves a generalized response, which leads to fungal cells having an increased efflux capacity. The same mutants end up being resistant to the distinct and most widely used antifungal fluconazole. Our results show that the paths followed by evolution are influenced by microecological conditions and that resistance to unrelated drugs can emerge from the same mutations.']"

We describe a flexible workflow to generate and annotate high-quality, full-length 16S rDNA amplicons. We evaluated it for two applications, namely, i) identification of bacterial isolates and ii) species-level profiling of microbial communities.\\n\\nMethodsBacterial isolate identification by sequencing was tested on 47 isolates and compared to MALDI-TOF MS. 97 isolates were additionally sequenced to assess the resolution of phylogenetic classification. Species-level community profiling was tested with two full-length 16S primer pairs (A and B) with custom barcodes and compared to results obtained with Illumina sequencing using 27 stool samples. Finally, a Nextflow pipeline was developed to produce high-quality reads and taxonomically annotate them.\\n\\nResultsWe found high agreement between our workflow and MALDI-TOF data for isolate identification (PPV = 0.90, Cramers V = 0.857 and, Theils U = 0.316). For species-level community profiling, we found strong correlations (rs > 0.6) of alpha diversity indices between the two primer sets and Illumina sequencing. At the community level, we found significant but small differences when comparing sequencing techniques. Finally, we found moderate to strong correlation when comparing relative abundances of individual species (average rs = 0.6 and 0.533, for primers A and B).\\n\\nDiscussionThe proposed workflow enabled accurate identification of single bacterial isolates, making it a worthwhile alternative to MALDI-TOF. While shortcomings have been identified, it enabled reliable identification of prominent features in microbial communities at a fraction of the cost of Illumina sequencing.\\n\\nImportanceA quick, robust, simple, and cost-effective method to identify bacterial isolates and communities in each sample is indispensable in the fields of microbiology and infection biology. Recent technological advances in Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing make this technique an attractive option considering the adaptability, portability, and cost-effectiveness of the platform. Here, we validated a flexible workflow to identify bacterial isolates and characterize bacterial communities using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform combined with the most recent v14 chemistry kits. For bacterial isolates, we compared our nanopore-based approach to MALDI-TOF MS-based identification. For species-level profiling of complex bacterial communities we compared our nanopore-based approach to Illumina shotgun sequencing. For reproducibility purposes, we wrapped the code used to process the sequencing data into a ready-to-use and self-contained Nextflow pipeline.', '2.Whole genome reconstruction of bacterial pathogens has become an import tool for tracking antimicrobial resistance spread, however accurate and complete assemblies have only been achievable using hybrid long and short-read sequencing. We have previously found the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10.4/kit12 flowcells produced improved assemblies over the R9.4.1/kit10, however they contained too many errors compared to hybrid Illumina-ONT assemblies. ONT have since released the R10.4.1/kit12 flowcells that promises greater accuracy and yield. They have also released newly trained basecallers using native bacterial DNA containing methylation sites intended to fix systematic errors, specifically Adenosine (A) to Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) to Thymine (T) substitutions. ONT have recommended the use of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) during library preparation to improve sequencing yield and accuracy. To evaluate these improvements, we sequenced DNA extracts from four commonly studied bacterial pathogens, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as 12 disparate E. coli clinical samples from different phylogroups and sequence types. These were all sequenced with and without BSA. These sequences were de novo assembled and compared against Illumina-corrected reference genomes. Here we have found the nanopore long read-only R10.4.1 (kit14) assemblies with basecallers trained using native bacterial methylated DNA produce accurate assemblies from 40x depth or higher, sufficient to be cost-effective compared to hybrid long-read (ONT) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing.\\n\\n3. Impact statementCurrently, the best method of building accurate and complete bacterial genome assemblies is to create a hybrid assembly; combining both long and short DNA sequencing reads. Short reads are more accurate, but can be difficult to assemble into a complete genome. Long reads are generally less accurate, but easier to reconstruct into a complete genome. By combining long and short reads, we get both accuracy and reconstructive power. However, this also involves higher costs and more labour than using a single sequencing platform. In this study, we compare long read only assemblies from Oxford Nanopore Technologys newest iteration of improvements in both chemistry and software to hybrid Illumina-Nanopore assemblies. We sequenced four bacterial pathogens with published reference genomes (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, and Escherichia Coli) and twelve bloodstream associated E. coli, and show that assemblies from the newest technology are not only an improvement on the previous iteration, but are able to compete with hybrid Illumina-Nanopore assemblies in their quality, providing a step towards bacterial genome assembly using a single sequencing platform.\\n\\n4.

However, this approach can be problematic or inadequate for bacteria, where there can be significant sequence divergence within a species.\\n\\nReference graphs are an emerging solution to the reference bias issues implicit in the \"single-reference\" model. Such a graph represents variation at multiple scales within a population - e.g., nucleotide- and locus-level.\\n\\nThe genetic causes of drug resistance in bacteria have proven comparatively easy to decode compared with studies of human diseases. For example, it is possible to predict resistance to numerous anti-tuberculosis drugs by simply testing for the presence of a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion/deletions, commonly referred to as a catalogue.\\n\\nWe developed DrPRG (Drug resistance Prediction with Reference Graphs) using the bacterial reference graph method Pandora. First, we outline the construction of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance reference graph, a process that can be replicated for other species. The graph is built from a global dataset of isolates with varying drug susceptibility profiles, thus capturing common and rare resistance- and susceptible-associated haplotypes. We benchmark DrPRG against the existing graph-based tool Mykrobe and the haplotype-based approach of TBProfiler using 44,709 and 138 publicly available Illumina and Nanopore samples with associated phenotypes. We find DrPRG has significantly improved sensitivity and specificity for some drugs compared to these tools, with no significant decreases. It uses significantly less computational memory than both tools, and provides significantly faster runtimes, except when runtime is compared to Mykrobe on Nanopore data.\\n\\nWe discover and discuss novel insights into resistance-conferring variation for M. tuberculosis - including deletion of genes katG and pncA - and suggest mutations that may warrant reclassification as associated with resistance.\\n\\n3. Impact statementMycobacterium tuberculosis is the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis (TB). TB is one of the leading causes of death worldwide; before the coronavirus pandemic it was the leading cause of death from a single pathogen. Drug-resistant TB incidence has recently increased, making the detection of resistance even more vital. In this study, we develop a new software tool to predict drug resistance from whole-genome sequence data of the pathogen using new reference graph models to represent a reference genome. We evaluate it on M. tuberculosis against existing tools for resistance prediction and show improved performance. Using our method, we discover new resistance-associated variations and discuss reclassification of a selection of existing mutations. As such, this work contributes to TB drug resistance diagnostic efforts. In addition, the method could be applied to any bacterial species, so is of interest to anyone working on antimicrobial resistance.\\n\\n4.

In vent ecosystems such as hydrothermal plumes, microorganisms rely on reduced chemicals and gases in hydrothermal fluids to fuel primary production and form diverse and complex microbial communities. However, microbial interactions that drive these complex microbiomes remain poorly understood. Here, we use microbiomes from the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal system in the Pacific Ocean to shed more light on the key species in these communities and their interactions. We built metabolic models from metagenomically assembled genomes (MAGs) and infer possible metabolic exchanges and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events within the community. We highlight possible archaea-archaea and archaea-bacteria interactions and their contributions to robustness of the community. Cellobiose, D-Mannose 1-phosphate, O2, CO2, and H2S were among the most exchanged metabolites. Ten microbes, including eight bacteria and two archaea, were identified as key contributors. These microorganisms uniquely enhanced the metabolic capabilities of the community by donating metabolites that cannot be produced by any other community member. Archaea from the DPANN group stood out as key microbes, benefiting significantly from accepting metabolites from other members of the microbiome. Amino acids were the key auxotrophy driving metabolic interactions in the community. Finally, over 200 horizontal gene transfer events were predicted in the community, the majority of which were between Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Overall, our study provides key insights into the microbial interactions that drive community structure and organisation in complex hydrothermal plumes and deep-sea microbiomes.', 'Heterotrophic marine bacteria utilize and recycle dissolved organic matter (DOM), impacting biogeochemical cycles. It is currently unclear to what extent distinct DOM components can be utilized by different heterotrophic clades. Here, we ask how a natural microbial community from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea responds to different molecular classes of DOM. These molecular classes - peptides, amino acids, amino sugars, disaccharides, monosaccharides and organic acids - together comprise much of the biomass of living organisms, released upon their death as DOM. Bulk bacterial activity increased after 24-hours for all treatments relative to the control, while glucose and ATP uptake decreased or remained unchanged. The relative abundance of several bacterial families, assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, increased in some treatments: peptides promoted an increase in Pseudoalteromonadaceae, disaccharides promoted both Pseudoalteromonadaceae and Alteromonadaceae, and most other treatments were dominated by Vibrionaceae. While some results were consistent with recent laboratory-based studies, for example Pseudoalteromonadaceae favoring peptides, other clades behaved differently. Alteromonadaceae, for example, grew well in the lab on many substrates but dominated in seawater samples when disaccharides were added. These results highlight the diversity in DOM utilization among heterotrophic bacteria and complexities in the response of natural communities.\\n\\nImportanceThe marine DOM pool contains numerous molecular classes, which change depending on the phytoplankton species, environmental conditions and interactions with other microbes, viruses and predators. In turn, the availability of these macromolecular pools affects the composition and function of the whole microbial community. Tracing the path between different carbon sources to specific microbes is another step towards revealing the dynamic interaction between bacteria and the DOM pool. This is especially important in warm and oligotrophic marine systems (e.g., Eastern Mediterranean Sea) where nutrients are scarce and may therefore affect microbial activity and growth.', 'The Arctic Ocean is an oligotrophic ecosystem facing escalating threats of oil spills as ship traffic increases owing to climate change-induced sea ice retreat. Biostimulation is an oil spill mitigation strategy that involves introducing bioavailable nutrients to enhance crude oil biodegradation by endemic oil-degrading microbes. For bioremediation to offer a viable response for future oil spill mitigation in extreme Arctic conditions, a better understanding of the effects of nutrient addition on Arctic marine microorganisms is needed. Comprehensive population tracking of controlled oil-spill microcosms using cell counting and microbial biodiversity screening revealed a significant decline in community diversity together with changes in microbial community composition. These shifts were also indicative of changes in prevailing genomic traits as inferred from 16S rRNA taxonomy of resulting communities. In addition to well-recognized hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, differential abundance analysis highlighted significant enrichment of unexpected genera Lacinutrix, Halarcobacter and Candidatus Pseudothioglobus. These groups have not been associated with hydrocarbon biodegradation until now, even though genomes from closely related isolates confirm the potential for hydrocarbon metabolism. These findings broaden understanding of marine oil spill bioremediation and how Arctic marine microbiomes and their novel lineages can respond to nutrient biostimulation as a strategy for oil spill mitigation.\\n\\nImportanceA comprehensive characterization and understanding of the impact of marine bioremediation strategies in the Arctic is crucial for effectively managing oil contamination. Such understanding enables an evaluation of the ecological impacts associated with mitigation strategies to minimize negative effects on sensitive ecosystems. By introducing external nutrients into areas affected by spills, microbial growth can be stimulated, enhancing hydrocarbon degradation by naturally occurring oil-degrading microorganisms. This may include novel microbial groups in permanently cold Arctic waters, where fewer oil biodegradation studies have been performed. It is also important to consider how nutrient addition may affect endemic microbial communities after successful remediation has occurred in oil-contaminated zones. Promoting naturally occurring oil-degrading microorganisms may have significant implications on nutrient cycling and marine food webs, which are critical for sustaining the health and well-being of coastal Indigenous communities in northern latitudes.']"

However, in mixed samples, such as metagenomes or organisms of higher ploidy, consensus induced biases can mask true variants affecting haplotypes of lower frequencies, because they are mistaken as errors.\\n\\nThe novelty presented here is to use graph based, instead of sequence based consensus as a template for identifying errors. The advantage is that graph based reference systems also capture variants of lower frequencies, so do not mistakenly mask them as errors. We present VeChat, as a novel approach to implement this idea: VeChat distinguishes errors from haplotype-specific true variants based on variation graphs, which reflect a popular type of data structure for pangenome reference systems. Upon initial construction of an ad-hoc variation graph from the raw input reads, nodes and edges that are due to errors are pruned from that graph by way of an iterative procedure that is based on principles from frequent itemset mining. Upon termination, the graph exclusively contains nodes and edges reflecting true sequential phenomena. Final re-alignments of the raw reads indicate where and how reads need to be corrected.\\n\\nExtensive benchmarking experiments demonstrate that PacBio and ONT reads corrected by VeChat contain 4 to 15, or, respectively, 2 to 10 times less errors than when corrected state of the art approaches. VeChat is implemented in an easy-to-use open-source tool and publicly available at https://github.com/HaploKit/vechat.', 'Pangenome reference graphs are useful in genomics because they compactly represent the genetic diversity within a species, a capability that linear references lack. However, efficiently aligning sequences to these graphs with complex topology and cycles can be challenging. The seed-chain-extend based alignment algorithms use co-linear chaining as a standard technique to identify a good cluster of exact seed matches that can be combined to form an alignment. Recent works show how the co-linear chaining problem can be efficiently solved for acyclic pangenome graphs by exploiting their small width [Makinen et al., TALG19] and how incorporating gap cost in the scoring function improves alignment accuracy [Chandra and Jain, RECOMB23]. However, it remains open on how to effectively generalize these techniques for general pangenome graphs which contain cycles. Here we present the first practical formulation and an exact algorithm for co-linear chaining on cyclic pangenome graphs. We rigorously prove the correctness and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm by aligning simulated long reads from the human genome to a cyclic pangenome graph constructed from 95 publicly available haplotype-resolved human genome assemblies. While the existing heuristic-based algorithms are faster, the proposed algorithm provides a significant advantage in terms of accuracy.\\n\\nImplementationhttps://github.com/at-cg/PanAligner', 'MotivationSequencing long reads presents novel challenges to mapping. One such challenge is low sequence similarity between the reads and the reference, due to high sequencing error and mutation rates. This occurs, e.g., in a cancer tumor, or due to differences between strains of viruses or bacteria. A key idea in mapping algorithms is to sketch sequences with their minimizers. Recently, syncmers were introduced as an alternative sketching method that is more robust to mutations and sequencing errors.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce parameterized syncmer schemes, a generalization of syncmers, and provide a theoretical analysis for multi-parameter schemes. By combining these schemes with downsampling or minimizers we can achieve any desired compression and window guarantee. We implemented the use of parameterized syncmer schemes in the popular minimap2 and Winnowmap2 mappers. In tests on simulated and real long read data from a variety of genomes, the syncmer-based algorithms, with scheme parameters selected on the basis of the theoretical analysis, reduced unmapped reads by 20-60% at high compression while usually using less memory. The advantage was more pronounced at low sequence identity. At sequence identity of 75% and medium compression, syncmer-minimap had only 37% as many unmapped reads, and 8% fewer of the reads that did map were incorrectly mapped. Even at lower compression and error rates, parameterized syncmer based mapping mapped more reads than the original minimizer-based mappers as well as mappers using the original syncmer schemes. We conclude that using parameterized syncmer schemes can improve mapping of long reads in a wide range of settings.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/Shamir-Lab/syncmer_mapping\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/syncmer_mapping.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPopular long read mappers use minimizers, the minimal hashed k-mers from overlapping windows, as alignment seeds. Recent work showed that syncmers, which select a fixed set of k-mers as seeds, are more likely to be conserved under errors or mutations than minimizers, making them potentially useful for mapping error-prone long reads. We introduce a framework for creating syncmers, that we call parameterized syncmer schemes, which generalize those introduced so far, and provide a theoretical analysis of their properties. We implemented parameterized syncmer schemes in the minimap2 and Winnowmap2 long read mappers. Using parameters selected on the basis of our theoretical analysis we demonstrate improved mapping performance, with fewer unmapped and incorrectly mapped reads on a variety of simulated and real datasets. The improvements are consistent across a broad range of compression rates and sequence identities, with the most significant improvements for lower sequence identity (high error or mutation rates) and high compression.']"

Novel regulators can be mined from genomes, but an inadequate understanding of their DNA specificity complicates genetic design. Here we present Snowprint, a simple yet powerful bioinformatic tool for predicting regulator:DNA interactions. Benchmarking results demonstrate that Snowprint predictions are significantly similar for >45% of experimentally validated regulator:operator pairs from organisms across nine phyla and for regulators that span five distinct structural families. We then use Snowprint to design promoters for 33 previously uncharacterized regulators sourced from diverse phylogenies, of which 28 were shown to influence gene expression and 24 produced a >20-fold signal-to-noise ratio. A panel of the newly domesticated regulators were then screened for response to biomanufacturing-relevant compounds, yielding new sensors for a polyketide (olivetolic acid), terpene (geraniol), steroid (ursodiol), and alkaloid (tetrahydropapaverine) with induction ranges up to 10.7-fold. Snowprint represents a unique, generalizable tool that greatly facilitates the discovery of ligand-inducible transcriptional regulators for bioengineering applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=119 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/538814v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (33K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f4939org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5066e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92d7cforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@968163_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG', 'Layered feedback is an optimization strategy in feedback control designs widely used in electrical and mechanical engineering. Layered control theory suggests that the performance of controllers is bound by the universal robustness-efficiency tradeoff limit, which could be overcome by layering two or more feedbacks together. In natural biological networks, genes are often regulated with redundancy and layering to adapt to environmental perturbations. Control theory hypothesizes that this layering architecture is also adopted by nature to overcome this performance trade-off. In this work, we validated this property of layered control with a synthetic network in living E. coli cells. We performed system analysis on a node-based design to confirm the tradeoff properties before proceeding to simulations with an effective mechanistic model, which guided us to the best performing design to engineer in cells. Finally, we interrogated its system dynamics experimentally with eight sets of perturbations on chemical signals, nutrient abundance, and growth temperature. For all cases, we consistently observed that the layered control overcomes the robustness-efficiency trade-off limit. This work experimentally confirmed that layered control could be adopted in synthetic biomolecular networks as a performance optimization strategy. It also provided insights in understanding genetic feedback control architectures in nature.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459953v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (11K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8312dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114c15borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a25baaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@301ebe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG', 'Energy and its dissipation are fundamental to all living systems, including cells. Insufficient abundance of energy carriers -as caused by the additional burden of artificial genetic circuits-shifts a cells priority to survival, also impairing the functionality of the genetic circuit. Moreover, recent works have shown the importance of energy expenditure in information transmission. Despite living organisms being non-equilibrium systems, non-equilibrium models capable of accounting for energy dissipation and non-equilibrium response curves are not yet employed in genetic design automation (GDA) software. To this end, we introduce Energy Aware Technology Mapping, the automated design of genetic logic circuits with respect to energy efficiency and functionality. The basis for this is an energy aware non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) model of gene expression, capturing characteristics like energy dissipation -which we link to the entropy production rate- and transcriptional bursting, relevant to eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. Our evaluation shows that a genetic logic circuits functional performance and energy efficiency are disjoint optimization goals. For our benchmark, energy efficiency improves by 37.2% on average when comparing to functionally optimized variants. We discover a linear increase in energy expenditure and overall protein expression with the circuit size, where Energy Aware Technology Mapping allows for designing genetic logic circuits with the energy efficiency of circuits that are one to two gates smaller. Structural variants improve this further, while results show the Pareto dominance among structures of a single Boolean function. By incorporating energy demand into the design, Energy Aware Technology Mapping enables energy efficiency by design. This extends current GDA tools and complements approaches coping with burden in vivo.\\n\\nTOC Graphic\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/601038v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\\nView larger version (23K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77317borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@151a140org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@318c19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4be6f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG']"

         "BackgroundBerberine, which is a naturally occurring alkaloid is widely explored for several health benefits including for weight management and metabolic disorders. The major pharmacological action of berberine is reported to be by activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, while its other clinical outcomes are devoid of clear mechanism of action/s. Hence in this study a detailed pharmacology of berberine and its two major metabolites (berberrubine, and jatrorrhizine) in humans was evaluated using well established Insilco tools.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe targets of berberine and its metabolites were identified in SwissTargetPrediction server and their affinity was assed using AutoDock vina 1.2.0. The binding pockets of the highest ligand receptor combinations was assessed using the PrankWeb: Ligand Binding Site Prediction tool.\n\nResultsKinases, enzymes and family A GPCRs were identified as the top three target category of berberine and its metabolites. ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT were observed to be the high affinity targets of berberine and its metabolites with affinity values of <4 uM. The affinity of berberine and its metabolites against all AMPKs and lipid/glucose regulator targets (LDLR, DDP4 and PCSK9) were > 10 uM. The IC50 value of berberine and its metabolites against ROCK2 was the least (<1 uM), while their other high affinity targets (PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) showed IC50 values < 5 uM.\n\nConclusionThe diverse range of protein targets and the observed novel high affinity targets (ROCK2, PIK3CD, KCNMA1, CSF1R and KIT) offer valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of action and therapeutic effects of berberine and its metabolites in various disease conditions, which warrants validation in suitable efficacy analysis studies.",

         "['Skeletal muscle regeneration requires the highly coordinated cooperation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) with other cellular components. However, due to technical limitations, it remains unclear how MuSCs dynamically interact with non-myogenic cells, especially myeloid cells, in live animals. In this work, we developed a dual-laser multimodal nonlinear optical microscope platform to serve as an effective tool for studying the real-time interaction between MuSCs and non-myogenic cells during the early phase of muscle regeneration. Increased cell volume and mitochondrial mass, cell density, and myotube formation are indicative of MuSCs activation/growth, proliferation, and differentiation, respectively. Using 3D time-lapse imaging on live reporter mice containing both red fluorescence protein (RFP)-labeled macrophages and yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-labeled MuSCs, and taking advantages of the autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), we monitored the real-time spatiotemporal interaction between RFP+ macrophages/RFP- non-myogenic cells and YFP+ muscle stem/progenitor cells during the activation and the proliferation stages of regeneration. Our results indicated that their cell-cell contact was transient in nature. By inhibiting macrophage infiltration, we further showed that direct cell-cell contact between macrophages and MuSCs was not required for early activation of MuSCs before the proliferation stage. However, decreased macrophage infiltration impeded the proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs and also led to intramuscular fibrosis. Besides, neutrophil depletion in the CCR2 deficient mice did not delay the initial growth of MuSCs. These findings provide a new perspective on myeloid cells role during muscle regeneration.', 'Cardiomyocytes undergo different metabolic changes during development and differentiation crucial for their maturation and adult function, such as contraction, growth and survival. Alterations of cardiac metabolism have been associated with multiple disease states and pathological hypertrophy. The shift in substrate preference can impair the stress response, but it may also have a role in cell growth and survival. Here, we evaluated the response of cardiomyocytes to the presence of exogenous lactate, an important metabolite for the fetal heart and cardiogenesis. Lactate-exposed mouse primary cardiomyocytes and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes quickly acquired a characteristic dedifferentiated phenotype, with enhanced proliferative capacity as determined by an increased expression of cell cycle (Ki67) and cytokinesis (Aurora-B) effectors. This effect was specific to cardiomyocytes and did not affect other heart cell populations (e.g. cardiac fibroblasts). Nevertheless, cardiac fibroblasts exposed to lactate promoted a pro-regenerative environment through the modulation of the release of cytokines (such as Fas, IL-13 or SDF1a). We characterized lactate-induced cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation through RNA-sequencing and gene expression analysis and identified increased expression of BMP10 (a TGF{beta} family protein involved in embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and stemness) and proteins associated to cell fate regulation (LIN28, TCIM) together with downregulation of cardiac maturation genes (GRIK1, DGKK). Bottom-up analysis suggested the phenotype promoted by lactate could be related to the activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. This finding indicated that, indeed, lactate may be a key player of hypoxic regenerative responses in the heart, as it usually accumulates as a result of glycolysis. In addition, ex vivo neonatal heart culture showed prolonged beating function and cardiac tissue integrity when culture media was supplemented with lactate. Thus, we conclude that lactate enhances cardiac proliferation by reprogramming cardiomyocytes towards a dedifferentiated stem cell-like state, supporting the notion that modulation of the metabolic microenvironment might be a powerful novel approach for promoting cardiac regeneration and tissue engineering applications.', 'Increased body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying basis of these associations are unclear. In order to assess this, we studied how IR and associated inflammation in adipose tissue developed in the presence of increased body iron stores. Male hepcidin knock-out (Hamp1-/-) mice, which have increased body iron stores, and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 and 24 weeks. Development of IR and metabolic parameters linked to this, insulin signaling in tissue, and inflammation and iron-related parameters in visceral adipose tissue were studied in these animals. HFD-feeding resulted in impaired glucose tolerance in both genotypes of mice. In response to the HFD for 24 weeks, Hamp1-/- mice gained less body weight and developed less IR than corresponding WT mice. This was associated with less lipid accumulation in the liver and decreased inflammation and lipolysis in the adipose tissue in the knock-out mice, than in the WT animals. Fewer macrophages infiltrated the adipose tissue in the knockout mice than in wild-type mice, with these macrophages exhibiting a predominantly anti-inflammatory (M2-like) phenotype. These observations suggest a novel role of hepcidin (central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis) in the development of inflammation in adipose tissue and insulin resistance, in response to a high-fat diet.\\n\\nCLINICAL PERSPECTIVESO_LIElevated body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking them are unclear.\\nC_LIO_LIIn response to high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding (to induce IR), mice that lacked hepcidin (Hamp1-/-) (and hence had elevated body iron stores) gained less body weight and developed less insulin resistance than wild-type (WT) mice.

This is in part due to the absence of pharmacologically-sensitive cognitive biomarkers common to humans and rodents. Here, we describe a cross-species translational marker of reward processing that is sensitive to the dopamine agonist, d-amphetamine. Motivated by human electroencephalographic (EEG) findings, we recently reported that frontal midline delta-band power is also an electrophysiological biomarker of reward surprise in mice. In the current series of experiments, we determined the impact of parametric doses of d-amphetamine on this reward-related EEG response from humans (n=23) and mice (n=28) performing a probabilistic learning task. In humans, d-amphetamine (placebo, 10 mg, 20 mg) boosted the Reward Positivity event-related potential (ERP) component as well as the spectral delta-band representations of this signal. In mice, d-amphetamine (placebo, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg) boosted both reward and punishment ERP features, yet there was no modulation of spectral activities. In sum, the present results confirm the role of dopamine in the generation of the Reward Positivity in humans, and paves the way towards a pharmacologically valid biomarker of reward sensitivity across species.",

         "['Decoding of brain tasks aims to identify individuals brain states and brain fingerprints to predict behavior. Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions. We hypothesized that ToM network brain connectivity could predict individual performance on false-belief tasks. We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

         "Marine bacteria rely on phytoplankton exudates as carbon sources (DOCp). Yet, it is unclear to what extent phytoplankton exudates also provide nutrients such as phytoplankton-derived N and P (DONp, DOPp). We address these questions by exudate addition experiments from the ubiquitous pico-cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus to contrasting ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean - a coastal and an open-ocean, oligotrophic station. Nutrient addition did not lower the incorporation of exudate DONp, nor did it reduce alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that bacterial communities are able to exclusively cover their nitrogen and phosphorus demands with organic forms provided by phytoplankton exudates. Approximately half of the cells in each ecosystem took up detectable amounts of Prochlorococcus-derived C and N, yet based on 16S rRNA sequencing different bacterial genera were responsible for the observed exudate utilization patterns. In the coastal community, several phylotypes of Aureimarina, Psychrosphaera and Glaciecola responded positively to the addition of phytoplankton exudates, whereas phylotypes of Pseudoalteromonas increased and dominated the open ocean communities. Together, our results strongly indicate that phytoplankton exudates provide coastal and open-ocean bacterial communities with organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and that phytoplankton exudate serve a full-fledged meal for specific members of the accompanying bacterial community in the nutrient-poor eastern Mediterranean.",

         "['Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are abundant on the ocean floor and play important roles in ocean biogeochemistry. In vent ecosystems such as hydrothermal plumes, microorganisms rely on reduced chemicals and gases in hydrothermal fluids to fuel primary production and form diverse and complex microbial communities. However, microbial interactions that drive these complex microbiomes remain poorly understood. Here, we use microbiomes from the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal system in the Pacific Ocean to shed more light on the key species in these communities and their interactions. We built metabolic models from metagenomically assembled genomes (MAGs) and infer possible metabolic exchanges and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events within the community. We highlight possible archaea-archaea and archaea-bacteria interactions and their contributions to robustness of the community. Cellobiose, D-Mannose 1-phosphate, O2, CO2, and H2S were among the most exchanged metabolites. Ten microbes, including eight bacteria and two archaea, were identified as key contributors. These microorganisms uniquely enhanced the metabolic capabilities of the community by donating metabolites that cannot be produced by any other community member. Archaea from the DPANN group stood out as key microbes, benefiting significantly from accepting metabolites from other members of the microbiome. Amino acids were the key auxotrophy driving metabolic interactions in the community. Finally, over 200 horizontal gene transfer events were predicted in the community, the majority of which were between Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Overall, our study provides key insights into the microbial interactions that drive community structure and organisation in complex hydrothermal plumes and deep-sea microbiomes.', 'Heterotrophic marine bacteria utilize and recycle dissolved organic matter (DOM), impacting biogeochemical cycles. It is currently unclear to what extent distinct DOM components can be utilized by different heterotrophic clades. Here, we ask how a natural microbial community from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea responds to different molecular classes of DOM. These molecular classes - peptides, amino acids, amino sugars, disaccharides, monosaccharides and organic acids - together comprise much of the biomass of living organisms, released upon their death as DOM. Bulk bacterial activity increased after 24-hours for all treatments relative to the control, while glucose and ATP uptake decreased or remained unchanged. The relative abundance of several bacterial families, assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, increased in some treatments: peptides promoted an increase in Pseudoalteromonadaceae, disaccharides promoted both Pseudoalteromonadaceae and Alteromonadaceae, and most other treatments were dominated by Vibrionaceae. While some results were consistent with recent laboratory-based studies, for example Pseudoalteromonadaceae favoring peptides, other clades behaved differently. Alteromonadaceae, for example, grew well in the lab on many substrates but dominated in seawater samples when disaccharides were added. These results highlight the diversity in DOM utilization among heterotrophic bacteria and complexities in the response of natural communities.\\n\\nImportanceThe marine DOM pool contains numerous molecular classes, which change depending on the phytoplankton species, environmental conditions and interactions with other microbes, viruses and predators. In turn, the availability of these macromolecular pools affects the composition and function of the whole microbial community. Tracing the path between different carbon sources to specific microbes is another step towards revealing the dynamic interaction between bacteria and the DOM pool. This is especially important in warm and oligotrophic marine systems (e.g., Eastern Mediterranean Sea) where nutrients are scarce and may therefore affect microbial activity and growth.', 'The Arctic Ocean is an oligotrophic ecosystem facing escalating threats of oil spills as ship traffic increases owing to climate change-induced sea ice retreat. Biostimulation is an oil spill mitigation strategy that involves introducing bioavailable nutrients to enhance crude oil biodegradation by endemic oil-degrading microbes. For bioremediation to offer a viable response for future oil spill mitigation in extreme Arctic conditions, a better understanding of the effects of nutrient addition on Arctic marine microorganisms is needed. Comprehensive population tracking of controlled oil-spill microcosms using cell counting and microbial biodiversity screening revealed a significant decline in community diversity together with changes in microbial community composition. These shifts were also indicative of changes in prevailing genomic traits as inferred from 16S rRNA taxonomy of resulting communities. In addition to well-recognized hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, differential abundance analysis highlighted significant enrichment of unexpected genera Lacinutrix, Halarcobacter and Candidatus Pseudothioglobus. These groups have not been associated with hydrocarbon biodegradation until now, even though genomes from closely related isolates confirm the potential for hydrocarbon metabolism. These findings broaden understanding of marine oil spill bioremediation and how Arctic marine microbiomes and their novel lineages can respond to nutrient biostimulation as a strategy for oil spill mitigation.\\n\\nImportanceA comprehensive characterization and understanding of the impact of marine bioremediation strategies in the Arctic is crucial for effectively managing oil contamination. Such understanding enables an evaluation of the ecological impacts associated with mitigation strategies to minimize negative effects on sensitive ecosystems. By introducing external nutrients into areas affected by spills, microbial growth can be stimulated, enhancing hydrocarbon degradation by naturally occurring oil-degrading microorganisms. This may include novel microbial groups in permanently cold Arctic waters, where fewer oil biodegradation studies have been performed. It is also important to consider how nutrient addition may affect endemic microbial communities after successful remediation has occurred in oil-contaminated zones. Promoting naturally occurring oil-degrading microorganisms may have significant implications on nutrient cycling and marine food webs, which are critical for sustaining the health and well-being of coastal Indigenous communities in northern latitudes.']",

The model comprises two partial differential equations that govern the cell volume fraction and the cell velocity, together with a moving boundary condition for the tumour edge. Numerical simulations of the model indicate that patterned solutions can be obtained, which correspond to multiple regions of high cell density separated by regions of low cell density. In other parameter regimes, solutions of the model can develop into a forward- or backward-moving travelling wave, corresponding to tumour growth or extinction, respectively. A travelling-wave analysis allows us to find the corresponding wave speed, as well as criteria for the growth or extinction of the tumour. Furthermore, a stability analysis of these travelling-wave solutions provides us with criteria for the occurrence of patterned solutions. Finally, we discuss how the initial cell distribution, as well as parameters related to cellular motion and cell-liquid drag, control the qualitative features of patterned solutions.",

         "['A proteins genetic architecture - the set of causal rules by which its sequence produces its functions - also determines its possible evolutionary trajectories. Prior research has proposed that genetic architecture of proteins is very complex, with pervasive epistatic interactions that constrain evolution and make function difficult to predict from sequence. Most of this work has analyzed only the direct paths between two proteins of interest - excluding the vast majority of possible genotypes and evolutionary trajectories - and has considered only a single protein function, leaving unaddressed the genetic architecture of functional specificity and its impact on the evolution of new functions. Here we develop a new method based on ordinal logistic regression to directly characterize the global genetic determinants of multiple protein functions from 20-state combinatorial deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. We use it to dissect the genetic architecture and evolution of a transcription factors specificity for DNA, using data from a combinatorial DMS of an ancient steroid hormone receptors capacity to activate transcription from two biologically relevant DNA elements. We show that the genetic architecture of DNA recognition consists of a dense set of main and pairwise effects that involve virtually every possible amino acid state in the protein-DNA interface, but higher-order epistasis plays only a tiny role. Pairwise interactions enlarge the set of functional sequences and are the primary determinants of specificity for different DNA elements. They also massively expand the number of opportunities for single-residue mutations to switch specificity from one DNA target to another. By bringing variants with different functions close together in sequence space, pairwise epistasis therefore facilitates rather than constrains the evolution of new functions.', 'Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce alternative phenotypes in response to its environment of development, is an important mechanism for coping with variable environments. While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low - but significant - effect of strain x environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.', 'Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow in a myriad of experimental conditions such that researchers have the ability to investigate any number of genotypes, strains, environments, or the interaction thereof. However, studies of variation in the yeast transcriptome have been limited by the processing capabilities of available RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform for yeasts. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage \"the awesome power of yeast\" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time, and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since we use the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique samples in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here we report transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, growth rate, metabolic strategies, stress responses, etc. all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.']",

         "['A proteins genetic architecture - the set of causal rules by which its sequence produces its functions - also determines its possible evolutionary trajectories. Prior research has proposed that genetic architecture of proteins is very complex, with pervasive epistatic interactions that constrain evolution and make function difficult to predict from sequence. Most of this work has analyzed only the direct paths between two proteins of interest - excluding the vast majority of possible genotypes and evolutionary trajectories - and has considered only a single protein function, leaving unaddressed the genetic architecture of functional specificity and its impact on the evolution of new functions. Here we develop a new method based on ordinal logistic regression to directly characterize the global genetic determinants of multiple protein functions from 20-state combinatorial deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. We use it to dissect the genetic architecture and evolution of a transcription factors specificity for DNA, using data from a combinatorial DMS of an ancient steroid hormone receptors capacity to activate transcription from two biologically relevant DNA elements. We show that the genetic architecture of DNA recognition consists of a dense set of main and pairwise effects that involve virtually every possible amino acid state in the protein-DNA interface, but higher-order epistasis plays only a tiny role. Pairwise interactions enlarge the set of functional sequences and are the primary determinants of specificity for different DNA elements. They also massively expand the number of opportunities for single-residue mutations to switch specificity from one DNA target to another. By bringing variants with different functions close together in sequence space, pairwise epistasis therefore facilitates rather than constrains the evolution of new functions.', 'Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce alternative phenotypes in response to its environment of development, is an important mechanism for coping with variable environments. While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low - but significant - effect of strain x environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.', 'Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow in a myriad of experimental conditions such that researchers have the ability to investigate any number of genotypes, strains, environments, or the interaction thereof. However, studies of variation in the yeast transcriptome have been limited by the processing capabilities of available RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform for yeasts. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage \"the awesome power of yeast\" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time, and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since we use the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique samples in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here we report transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, growth rate, metabolic strategies, stress responses, etc. all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.']",

The diploid progenitors of the A- and D-subgenomes have been unequivocally identified, that of B however remains ambiguous and controversial but is suspected to be related to species of Aegilops, section Sitopsis. Here, we report the assembly of chromosome-level genome sequences of all five Sitopsis species, namely Ae. bicornis, Ae. longissima, Ae. searsii, Ae. sharonensis, and Ae. speltoides, as well as partial assembly of Ae. mutica genome for phylogenetic analysis. Our results support that the donor of bread wheat B-subgenome is a distinct, probably extinct, diploid species that diverged from an ancestral progenitor of the B-lineage similar to Ae. mutica and Ae. speltoides. The five Sitopsis species have variable genome sizes (4.11-5.89 Gb) with high proportions of repetitive sequences (85.99-89.81%); nonetheless, they retain high collinearity with other wheat genomes. Differences in genome size are primarily due to independent post-speciation amplification of transposons rather than to inter-specific genetic introgression. We also identified a set of Sitopsis genes pertinent to important agronomic traits that can be harnessed for wheat breeding. These resources provide a new roadmap for evolutionary and genetic studies of the wheat group.\n\nSignificanceThe origin of the B-subgenome of hexaploid bread wheat remains unknown. Here we report the assembly of chromosome-level genome sequences of all five Sitopsis species of the genus Aegilops, which are previously considered as possible direct progenitors or contributors to the B-subgenome. Our comparative genomic analyses reveal that the B-subgenome originated from an unknown, most likely extinct species phylogenetically distinct from Ae. speltoides, its extant closest relative. We also provide evidence that Ae. speltoides is neither the direct progenitor of the G-subgenome of tetraploid wheat Triticum timopheevii. The high-quality Sitopsis genomes provide novel avenues to identify new important genes for wheat breeding.",

However, it remains unclear how heritable the microbiome is with respect to the host plant genotype and to what extent host genetic mechanisms can modulate plant-microbe interactions in the face of environmental stress. Here, we surveyed the root and rhizosphere microbiome of 129 accessions of locally adapted Zea mays, sourced from diverse habitats and grown under control and different stress conditions. We quantified treatment and host genotype effects on the microbiome. Plant genotype and source environment were predictive of microbiome composition. Genome wide association analysis identified host genetic variants linked to both rhizosphere microbiome composition and source environment. We identified transposon insertions in a candidate gene linked to both the abundance of a keystone microbe Massilia and source total soil nitrogen, finding mutant plants to show a reduction in lateral root density. We conclude that locally adapted maize varieties exert patterns of genetic control on their root and rhizosphere microbiomes that follow variation in their home environments, consistent with a role in tolerance to prevailing stress.', 'Associations with soil microorganisms are crucial for plants overall health and functioning. While much work has been done to understand drivers of rhizosphere microbiome structure and function, the relative importance of geography, climate, soil properties, and plant genetics remains unclear, as results have been mixed and comprehensive studies across many sites and genotypes are limited. Rhizosphere microbiomes are crucial for crop resistance to pathogens, stress tolerance, nutrient availability, and ultimately yield. Here we quantify the relative roles of plant genotype, environment, and their interaction in shaping soil rhizosphere communities, using 16S and ITS gene sequencing of rhizosphere soils from 10 common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genotypes from 15 sites across the Great Plains of the United States. While site generally outweighed genotype overall in terms of effects on archaeal, bacterial and fungal richness, community composition, and taxa relative abundances, there was also a significant interaction such that genotype exerted a significant influence on archaeal, bacterial and fungal microbiomes in certain sites. Site effects were attributed to a combination of spatial distance and differences in climate and soil properties. Microbial taxa that were previously associated with resistance to the fungal necrotrophic pathogen Sclerotinia were present in most sites but differed significantly in relative abundance across sites. Our results have implications for plant breeding and agronomic microbiome manipulations for agricultural improvement across different geographic regions.\\n\\nImportanceDespite the importance of plant breeding in agriculture, we still have a limited understanding of how plant genetic variation shapes soil microbiome composition across broad geographic regions. Using 15 sites across the Great Plains of North America, we show that cultivated sunflower rhizosphere archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities are driven primarily by site soil and climatic differences, but that genotype can interact with site to influence composition, especially in warmer and drier sites with lower overall microbial richness. We also show that all taxa that were previously found to be associated with resistance to the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were widespread but significantly affected by site, while a subset were also significantly affected by genotype. Our results contribute to a broader understanding of rhizosphere archaeal, bacterial and fungal community assembly, and provide foundational knowledge for plant breeding efforts and potential future microbiome manipulations in agriculture.', 'Plant secondary metabolites that are released into the rhizosphere alter biotic and abiotic soil properties, which in turn affect the performance of other plants. How such plant-soil feedbacks affect agricultural productivity and food quality in crop rotations is unknown. Here, we assessed the impact of maize benzoxazinoids on the performance, yield and food quality of three winter wheat varieties in a two-year field experiment. Following maize cultivation, we detected benzoxazinoid-dependent chemical and microbial fingerprints in the soil. The chemical fingerprint was still visible during wheat growth, while the microbial fingerprint was no longer detected. Benzoxazinoid soil conditioning by wild-type maize led to increased wheat emergence, tillering, growth and biomass compared to soil conditioning by bx1 mutant plants. Weed cover remained unaffected, while insect damage decreased in a subset of varieties. Wheat yield was increased by over 4% without a reduction in grain quality across varieties. This improvement was directly associated with increased germination and tillering. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that plant secondary metabolites can increase yield via plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions. If this phenomenon holds across different soils and environmental conditions, optimizing plant root exudation could be a powerful, genetically tractable strategy to enhance crop yields without additional inputs.']",

We developed an in silico deep-learning strategy to quantify the effect of any insertion, deletion, inversion, or substitution on chromatin contacts and systematically scored millions of synthetic variants. While most genetic manipulations have little impact, regions with CTCF motifs and active transcription are highly sensitive, as expected. However, our analysis also points to noncoding RNA genes and several families of repetitive elements as CTCF motif-free DNA sequences with particularly large effects on nearby chromatin interactions, sometimes exceeding the effects of CTCF sites and explaining interactions that lack CTCF.

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors. The datasets, analyses, and tools presented here will enable the generation of testable hypotheses about the cell and organ-specific function of genes in diverse biological contexts.', 'Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.']",

Whiting (Merlangius merlangus) is a demersal temperate fish, considered a  relict species in the Adriatic Sea. Despite its significance to commercial fisheries in the region, the specific drivers behind its spatial and temporal patterns have not been thoroughly examined. Here, we fitted a set of Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models to data collected in the Northern and Central Adriatic from 1999 to 2019 during the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey to investigate the potential influence of depth, seafloor temperature and bottom dissolved oxygen on the annual biomass density and spatial distribution of whiting. Our results showed that depth, and to a lesser degree temperature and oxygen, are important predictors of whiting distribution in spring-summer, with preferences for depths of [~] 45 m, temperature of [~] 15.4 {degrees}C and dissolved oxygen > 5.5 ml L-1. We predicted a persistent core area of distribution in front of the Po River Delta, in the Northern Adriatic Sea, while the density progressively declined towards the Central and Southern Adriatic Sea along the Italian coast. Additionally, the temporal trend exhibited high fluctuations over the years, occurring in cycles of 3 to 4 years. Finally, by comparing the biomass density estimates obtained under optimum conditions with those derived from the actual values for each variable, our analysis revealed that temperature had a pronounced and general impact on biomass density in the northern survey area (prediction revealed a ratio of density reduction of approximatively a half), while oxygen displayed a minor and more localized influence. This work deepens the current knowledge about the ecology of whiting in the Adriatic Sea and provides support for the conservation and management of this species.",

Understanding the links between traits and fitness is therefore critical for predicting how populations and communities respond to environmental change. However, the net effects of traits on species fitness are largely unknown because we have lacked a framework for estimating fitness across multiple species and environments.\\nC_LIO_LIWe present a modeling framework that integrates trait effects on demographic performance over the life cycles of individuals to estimate the net effect of traits on species fitness. This approach involves 1) modeling trait effects on individual demographic rates (growth, survival, and recruitment) as multidimensional performance surfaces that vary with individual size and environment and 2) integrating these effects into a population model to project population growth rates (i.e., fitness) as a function of traits and environment. We illustrate our approach by estimating performance surfaces and fitness landscapes for trees across a temperature gradient in the eastern United States.\\nC_LIO_LIFunctional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, and maximum height) interacted with individual size and temperature to influence tree growth, survival, and recruitment rates, generating demographic trade-offs and shaping the contours of fitness landscapes. Tall tree species had high survival, growth, and fitness across the temperature gradient. Wood density and specific leaf area had interactive effects on demographic performance, resulting in fitness landscapes with multiple peaks.\\nC_LIO_LIWith this approach it is now possible to empirically estimate the net effect of traits on fitness, leading to improved understanding of the selective forces that drive community assembly and permitting generalizable predictions of population and community dynamics in changing environments.\\nC_LI', 'Climates are changing rapidly, demanding equally rapid adaptation of natural populations. Whether sexual selection can aid such adaptation is under debate; while sexual selection should promote adaptation when individuals with high mating success are also best adapted to their local surroundings, the expression of sexually selected traits can incur costs. Here we asked what the demographic consequences of such costs may be once climates change to become harsher and the strength of natural selection increases. We investigated how an evolutionary history of strong postcopulatory sexual selection (sperm competition) affects male fertility under acute adult heat stress. Harnessing the empirical potential of long-term experimental evolution in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we assessed the thermal sensitivity of fertility (TSF) in replicated lines maintained for 68 generations under three alternative mating regimes manipulating the opportunity for sexual and natural selection. We find that males evolving under strong sexual selection suffer from increased TSF, and that male success in sperm competition (P2: sperm offense) is genetically correlated to increased TSF. Interestingly, females from the regime under strong sexual selection, who experienced relaxed selection on their own reproductive effort, had high fertility in benign settings but suffered increased TSF, like their brothers. This implies that female fertility and TSF evolved through genetic correlation with reproductive traits sexually selected in males. Paternal but not maternal heat stress reduced offspring fertility with no evidence for adaptive transgenerational plasticity among heat-exposed offspring, indicating that the observed effects may compound over generations. Our results suggest that trade-offs between fertility and traits increasing success in postcopulatory sexual selection can be revealed in harsh environments. This can put polyandrous species under increased risk during extreme heat waves expected under future climate change.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTHow will populations respond to a warming world? Of increasing concern are negative effects of elevated temperatures on fertility, which in many species are observed for temperatures substantially lower than the ones causing death. Incorporating knowledge on species-specific thermal fertility limits has improved estimates of current species ranges but renders a more pessimistic view of the potential for adaptive responses under climate change. Sexual selection is a process that can interact with thermal sensitivity of fertility and is strongest in males of polyandrous species, in which females mate multiply and sperm of multiple males compete for fertilization of female eggs. Therefore, males of polyandrous species often invest heavily in sperm competition. However, given finite resources, increased investment in sperm competition can come at an expense of other processes needed to maintain the integrity of the male germline, which when compromised can reduce fertility and offspring quality. How may such male investment, fuelled by sexual selection, affect species responses to climate warming? To address this question, we first evolved populations under different laboratory settings that independently manipulated the levels of natural and sexual selection. We exposed adults from these populations to acute heat stress and measured the fertility of males and females. We find that sexual selection on males leads to a fertility debt that is revealed under heat stress. This debt was also apparent in females, who themselves were not selected for increased reproductive investment. Thus, genes under sexual selection in males seems to have impaired fertility in both sexes under heat stress. Forecasts of species response to climate change that do not incorporate thermal fertility limits and sexual selection may therefore underestimate species vulnerability to increasing temperatures.', 'Abiotic environmental conditions play a key role in driving the size and shape of organisms. Quantifying environment-morphology relationships is important not only for understanding the fundamental processes driving phenotypic diversity within and among species (1), but also for predicting how species will respond to ongoing global change (2). Despite a clear set of expectations motivated by ecological theory (3), broad evidence in support of generalizable effects of abiotic conditions, such as temperature (4), on spatial and temporal intraspecific morphological variation has been limited. Using standardized data from over 250,000 captures of 105 landbird species, we assessed intraspecific shifts in bird morphology since 1989 while simultaneously measuring spatial morphological gradients across the North American continent. Across bird species, we found strong spatial and temporal trends in body size, with warmer temperatures associated with smaller body sizes both at more equatorial latitudes and in more recent years. The magnitude of these thermal effects varied both across and within species, with results suggesting it is the warmest, rather than the coldest, temperatures driving both spatial and temporal trends. Across elevation, we found that body size declines as relative wing length increases, likely due to the benefits that longer wings confer for flight in thin air environments. Our results provide support for both existing and new large-scale ecomorphological gradients and highlight how the response of functional tradeoffs to abiotic variation drives morphological change.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCharacterizing how the size and shape of organisms varies over space and time is key to understanding the processes that create ecological communities and for predicting how species will respond to climate change. Across more than 100 species of North American birds, we show that within species the size and shape of individuals varies substantially across space and time. Warmer temperatures are associated with smaller body sizes, likely due to the importance of body size for thermoregulation. As the climate continues to warm, these species will likely continue to shrink. We also provide the first large-scale evidence of an increase in wing length with elevation, a pattern that could be attributed to thinner air in high elevation environments.']",

Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions.

We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

Paradoxically, repeated use of opioid analgesics may cause an exacerbated pain state known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), which significantly contributes to dose escalation and consequently opioid overdose. Neuronal malplasticity in pain circuits has been the predominant proposed mechanism of OIH expression. Although glial cells are known to become reactive in OIH animal models, their biological contribution to OIH remains to be defined and their activation mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that reactive astrocytes (a.k.a. astrogliosis) are critical for OIH development in both male and female mice. Genetic ablation of astrogliosis inhibited the expression of OIH and morphine-induced neural circuit polarization (NCP) in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH). We found that Wnt5a is a neuron-to-astrocyte signal that is required for morphine-induced astrogliosis. Conditional knock-out of Wnt5a in neurons or its co-receptor ROR2 in astrocytes blocked not only morphine-induced astrogliosis but also OIH and NCP. Furthermore, we showed that the Wnt5a-ROR2 signaling-dependent astrogliosis contributes to OIH via inflammasome-regulated IL-1{beta}. Our results reveal an important role of morphine-induced astrogliosis in OIH pathogenesis and elucidate a neuron-to-astrocyte intercellular Wnt signaling pathway that controls the astrogliosis.",

         "['Decoding of brain tasks aims to identify individuals brain states and brain fingerprints to predict behavior. Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions. We hypothesized that ToM network brain connectivity could predict individual performance on false-belief tasks. We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

Anyhow, BoHV-4 infection is not associated to a specific disease. Genome structure and genes are well conserved in Gammaherpesvirus, and orf45 gene and its product, ORF45, is one of those. BoHV-4 ORF45 has been suggested to be a tegument protein, however, BoHV-4 ORF45 structure and function have not yet been experimentally characterized. In the present study, it is shown that BoHV-4 ORF45, despite its poor homology with other characterized Rhadinovirus ORF45s, is structurally related to Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is a phosphoprotein and localizes in the host cell nuclei. Through the generation of an ORF45-null mutant BoHV-4 and its pararevertant, it was possible to demonstrate that ORF45 is essential for BoHV-4 lytic replication and is associated to the viral particles, as for the other characterized Rhadinovirus ORF45s. Finally, the impact of BoHV-4 ORF45 on cellular transcriptome was investigated, an aspect poorly explored or not at all for other Gammaherpesvirus. Many cellular transcriptional pathways were found to be alterate, mainly those involving p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) and signal-regulated kinase (ERK) complex (RSK/ERK), thus highlighting the authentic character of BoHV-4 ORF45 and paving the way to further investigations.",

Prior research has proposed that genetic architecture of proteins is very complex, with pervasive epistatic interactions that constrain evolution and make function difficult to predict from sequence. Most of this work has analyzed only the direct paths between two proteins of interest - excluding the vast majority of possible genotypes and evolutionary trajectories - and has considered only a single protein function, leaving unaddressed the genetic architecture of functional specificity and its impact on the evolution of new functions. Here we develop a new method based on ordinal logistic regression to directly characterize the global genetic determinants of multiple protein functions from 20-state combinatorial deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. We use it to dissect the genetic architecture and evolution of a transcription factors specificity for DNA, using data from a combinatorial DMS of an ancient steroid hormone receptors capacity to activate transcription from two biologically relevant DNA elements. We show that the genetic architecture of DNA recognition consists of a dense set of main and pairwise effects that involve virtually every possible amino acid state in the protein-DNA interface, but higher-order epistasis plays only a tiny role. Pairwise interactions enlarge the set of functional sequences and are the primary determinants of specificity for different DNA elements. They also massively expand the number of opportunities for single-residue mutations to switch specificity from one DNA target to another. By bringing variants with different functions close together in sequence space, pairwise epistasis therefore facilitates rather than constrains the evolution of new functions.', 'Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce alternative phenotypes in response to its environment of development, is an important mechanism for coping with variable environments. While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low - but significant - effect of strain x environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.', 'Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow in a myriad of experimental conditions such that researchers have the ability to investigate any number of genotypes, strains, environments, or the interaction thereof.

Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform for yeasts.

Such genetic background effects are commonly observed, including in the context of many human diseases. However, systematic characterization of these effects at the species level is still lacking to date. Here, we sought to comprehensively survey background-dependent traits associated with gene loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in 39 natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a transposon saturation strategy. By analyzing the modeled fitness variability of a total of 4,469 genes, we found that 15% of them, when impacted by a LoF mutation, exhibited a significant gain- or loss-of-fitness phenotype in certain natural isolates compared to the reference strain S288C. Out of these 632 genetic background-dependent fitness genes identified, a total of 2/3 show a continuous variation across the population while 1/3 are specific to a single genetic background. Genes related to mitochondrial function are significantly overrepresented in the set of genes showing a continuous variation and display a potential functional rewiring with other genes involved in transcription and chromatin remodeling as well as in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. Such rewiring effects are likely modulated by both the genetic background and the environment. While background-specific cases are rare and span diverse cellular processes, they can be functionally related at the individual level. All background-dependent fitness genes tend to have an intermediate connectivity in the global genetic interaction network and have shown relaxed selection pressure at the population level, highlighting their potential evolutionary characteristics.",

To investigate this biological problem, we capitalized on a Drosophila tumor model highly relevant for humans that relies on the concomitant upregulation of EGFR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Our results indicate that widespread non-apoptotic activation of initiator caspases limits JNK signaling and facilitates cell fate commitment in these tumors, thus preventing the overgrowth and exacerbation of malignant features. Intriguingly, these caspase functions are strongly linked to the ability of these enzymes to control the recruitment and subsequent proliferation in situ of macrophage-like cells on the tumor.

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors.

Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population.

However, due to technical limitations, it remains unclear how MuSCs dynamically interact with non-myogenic cells, especially myeloid cells, in live animals. In this work, we developed a dual-laser multimodal nonlinear optical microscope platform to serve as an effective tool for studying the real-time interaction between MuSCs and non-myogenic cells during the early phase of muscle regeneration. Increased cell volume and mitochondrial mass, cell density, and myotube formation are indicative of MuSCs activation/growth, proliferation, and differentiation, respectively. Using 3D time-lapse imaging on live reporter mice containing both red fluorescence protein (RFP)-labeled macrophages and yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-labeled MuSCs, and taking advantages of the autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), we monitored the real-time spatiotemporal interaction between RFP+ macrophages/RFP- non-myogenic cells and YFP+ muscle stem/progenitor cells during the activation and the proliferation stages of regeneration. Our results indicated that their cell-cell contact was transient in nature. By inhibiting macrophage infiltration, we further showed that direct cell-cell contact between macrophages and MuSCs was not required for early activation of MuSCs before the proliferation stage. However, decreased macrophage infiltration impeded the proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs and also led to intramuscular fibrosis. Besides, neutrophil depletion in the CCR2 deficient mice did not delay the initial growth of MuSCs. These findings provide a new perspective on myeloid cells role during muscle regeneration.', 'Cardiomyocytes undergo different metabolic changes during development and differentiation crucial for their maturation and adult function, such as contraction, growth and survival. Alterations of cardiac metabolism have been associated with multiple disease states and pathological hypertrophy. The shift in substrate preference can impair the stress response, but it may also have a role in cell growth and survival. Here, we evaluated the response of cardiomyocytes to the presence of exogenous lactate, an important metabolite for the fetal heart and cardiogenesis. Lactate-exposed mouse primary cardiomyocytes and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes quickly acquired a characteristic dedifferentiated phenotype, with enhanced proliferative capacity as determined by an increased expression of cell cycle (Ki67) and cytokinesis (Aurora-B) effectors. This effect was specific to cardiomyocytes and did not affect other heart cell populations (e.g. cardiac fibroblasts). Nevertheless, cardiac fibroblasts exposed to lactate promoted a pro-regenerative environment through the modulation of the release of cytokines (such as Fas, IL-13 or SDF1a). We characterized lactate-induced cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation through RNA-sequencing and gene expression analysis and identified increased expression of BMP10 (a TGF{beta} family protein involved in embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and stemness) and proteins associated to cell fate regulation (LIN28, TCIM) together with downregulation of cardiac maturation genes (GRIK1, DGKK). Bottom-up analysis suggested the phenotype promoted by lactate could be related to the activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. This finding indicated that, indeed, lactate may be a key player of hypoxic regenerative responses in the heart, as it usually accumulates as a result of glycolysis. In addition, ex vivo neonatal heart culture showed prolonged beating function and cardiac tissue integrity when culture media was supplemented with lactate. Thus, we conclude that lactate enhances cardiac proliferation by reprogramming cardiomyocytes towards a dedifferentiated stem cell-like state, supporting the notion that modulation of the metabolic microenvironment might be a powerful novel approach for promoting cardiac regeneration and tissue engineering applications.', 'Increased body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying basis of these associations are unclear. In order to assess this, we studied how IR and associated inflammation in adipose tissue developed in the presence of increased body iron stores. Male hepcidin knock-out (Hamp1-/-) mice, which have increased body iron stores, and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 and 24 weeks. Development of IR and metabolic parameters linked to this, insulin signaling in tissue, and inflammation and iron-related parameters in visceral adipose tissue were studied in these animals. HFD-feeding resulted in impaired glucose tolerance in both genotypes of mice. In response to the HFD for 24 weeks, Hamp1-/- mice gained less body weight and developed less IR than corresponding WT mice. This was associated with less lipid accumulation in the liver and decreased inflammation and lipolysis in the adipose tissue in the knock-out mice, than in the WT animals. Fewer macrophages infiltrated the adipose tissue in the knockout mice than in wild-type mice, with these macrophages exhibiting a predominantly anti-inflammatory (M2-like) phenotype. These observations suggest a novel role of hepcidin (central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis) in the development of inflammation in adipose tissue and insulin resistance, in response to a high-fat diet.\\n\\nCLINICAL PERSPECTIVESO_LIElevated body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

         "['The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors. The datasets, analyses, and tools presented here will enable the generation of testable hypotheses about the cell and organ-specific function of genes in diverse biological contexts.', 'Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.']",

However, VNS is critically limited by the unwanted stimulation of nearby neck muscles - a result of non-specific stimulation activating motor nerve fibers within the vagus. Prior studies suggested that precise placement of small epineural electrodes can modify VNS therapeutic effects, such as cardiac responses. However, it remains unclear if placement can alter the balance between intended effect and limiting side effect.\n\nWe used an FDA investigational device exemption approved six-contact epineural cuff to deliver VNS in pigs and quantified how epineural electrode location impacts on- and off-target VNS activation. Detailed post-mortem histology was conducted to understand how the underlying neuroanatomy impacts observed functional responses. Here we report the discovery and characterization of clear neuroanatomy-dependent differences in threshold and saturation for responses related to both effect (change in heart rate) and side effect (neck muscle contractions). The histological and electrophysiological data were used to develop and validate subject-specific computation models of VNS, creating a well-grounded quantitative framework to optimize electrode location-specific activation of nerve fibers governing intended effect versus unwanted side effect.",

Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions. We hypothesized that ToM network brain connectivity could predict individual performance on false-belief tasks. We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

         "The early embryonic divisions of many organisms, including fish, flies and frogs are characterised by a very rapid S-phase caused by high rates of replication initiation. In somatic cells, S-phase is much longer due to both a reduction in the total number of initiation events and the imposition of a temporal order of origin activation. The physiological importance of changes in the rate and timing of replication initiation in S-phase remains unclear. Here we assess the importance of the temporal control of replication initiation using a conditional system in budding yeast to drive the early replication of all origins in a single cell cycle. We show that global early replication disrupts the expression of over a quarter of all genes. By deleting individual origins, we show that delaying replication is sufficient to restore normal gene expression, directly establishing replication timing control in this regulation. Global early replication disrupts nucleosome positioning and transcription factor binding during S-phase, suggesting that the rate of S-phase is important to regulate the chromatin landscape. Together these data provide new insight into the role of a temporal order of origin firing for coordinating replication, gene expression and chromatin establishment as occurs in the early embryo.",

The accurate determination of binding affinities, essential for decoding PPIs, faces challenges due to the substantial time and financial costs involved in experimental and theoretical methods. This situation underscores the urgent need for more effective and precise methodologies for predicting binding affinity. Despite the abundance of research on PPI modeling, the field of quantitative binding affinity prediction remains underexplored, mainly due to a lack of comprehensive data.\\n\\nThis study seeks to address these needs by manually curating pairwise interaction labels on all available 3D structures of proteins complexes, with experimentally determined binding affinities, creating the largest dataset for structure-based pairwise protein interaction with binding affinity to date. Subsequently, we introduce \"ProAffinity-GNN\", a novel deep learning framework using protein language model and graph neural network (GNN) to improve the accuracy of prediction of structure-based protein-protein binding affinities. The evaluation results across several benchmark test sets demonstrate that ProAffinity-GNN not only outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy but also shows strong generalization capabilities.', 'Protein-RNA interactions play a critical role in many cellular processes and pathologies. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and {pi}-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are due to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer belong to the interface in the interolog, a phenomenon we term \"interface switching out\". We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarii of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.', 'Protein therapeutics play an important role in controlling the functions and activities of disease-causing proteins in modern medicine. Despite protein therapeutics having several advantages over traditional small-molecule therapeutics, further development has been hindered by drug complexity and delivery issues. However, recent progress in deep learning-based protein structure prediction approaches such as AlphaFold opens new opportunities to exploit the complexity of these macro-biomolecules for highly-specialised design to inhibit, regulate or even manipulate specific disease-causing proteins. Anti-CRISPR proteins are small proteins from bacteriophages that counter-defend against the prokaryotic adaptive immunity of CRISPR-Cas systems. They are unique examples of natural protein therapeutics that have been optimized by the host-parasite evolutionary arms race to inhibit a wide variety of host proteins. Here, we show that these Anti-CRISPR proteins display diverse inhibition mechanisms through accurate structural prediction and functional analysis. We find that these phage-derived proteins are extremely distinct in structure, some of which have no homologues in the current protein structure domain. Furthermore, we find a novel family of Anti-CRISPR proteins which are structurally homologous to the recently-discovered mechanism of manipulating host proteins through enzymatic activity, rather than through direct inference. Using highly accurate structure prediction, we present a wide variety of protein-manipulating strategies of anti-CRISPR proteins for future protein drug design.']",

These compounds target inhibition of the NaV1.6 and NaV1.2 channels in excitatory pyramidal neurons and possess a molecular selectivity of >100 fold against NaV1.1 channels that are dominant in inhibitory cells. This profile will enable pharmacological dissection of the physiological roles of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 and help to define the role of each channel in disease states. These compounds bind to and stabilize the inactivated-state of the channels, demonstrate higher potency with longer residency times, and slower off-rates than carbamazepine and phenytoin. These compounds possess cellular selectivity ex vivo in inhibiting action potential firing in cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons, whilst sparing fast spiking inhibitory interneurons.

To identify how inductive biases are implemented in and shaped by neural codes, we analyze sample-efficient learning of arbitrary stimulus-response maps from arbitrary neural codes with biologically-plausible readouts. We develop an analytical theory that predicts the generalization error of the readout as a function of the number of observed examples. Our theory illustrates in a mathematically precise way how the structure of population codes shapes inductive bias, and how a match between the code and the task is crucial for sample-efficient learning. We observe that many different codes can support the same inductive bias. By analyzing recordings from the mouse primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that biological codes have lower total activity than other codes with identical bias. Using these mouse primary visual cortex responses, we demonstrate the existence of an efficiency bias towards low frequency orientation discrimination tasks for grating stimuli and low spatial frequency reconstruction tasks for natural images. We reproduce the discrimination bias in a simple model of primary visual cortex, and further show how invariances in the code to certain stimulus variations alter learning performance. We extend our methods to time-dependent neural codes and predict the sample efficiency of readouts from recurrent networks. Finally, we discuss implications of our theory in the context of recent developments in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Overall, our study provides a concrete method for elucidating inductive biases of the brain and promotes sample-efficient learning as a general normative coding principle.",

For example, the taste of sugar robustly promotes feeding1, 2 but also influences other behaviors, such as altering locomotor patterns to maximize food-finding3, 4 or conferring a rewarding value onto associated contexts or cues.5-7 Here, we investigate how sweet taste elicits multiple appetitive behaviors in Drosophila. Are different sugar-evoked behaviors coordinately regulated? At what point does the sugar circuit diverge into different pathways that drive distinct behaviors? We first established an optogenetic paradigm to study the effects of sugar taste on locomotion, spatial preference, and associative learning. We then tested how different sugar-evoked behaviors were modulated by internal and external factors, including hunger, diet, or the presence of an aversive taste. Different behaviors were generally modulated in similar ways, but we also observed some differences that reveal selective modulation of specific behavioral pathways. Finally, we investigated where the sugar taste circuit diverges into different behavioral pathways. A recent study identified a sensory-motor circuit comprising five layers of neurons that drives the initiation of feeding in response to sugar.8 By individually manipulating each of these neurons, we show that circuits mediating different innate responses to sugar are partially overlapping and begin to diverge at the level of second- and third-order neurons, whereas circuits for innate versus learned behaviors may diverge at the first synapse. Connectomic analyses reveal distinct subcircuits that mediate different behaviors.

We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions. We hypothesized that ToM network brain connectivity could predict individual performance on false-belief tasks. We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

         "Azole antifungals inhibit the sterol C14-demethylase (CYP51/Erg11), a key enzyme in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. They have fungistatic effects against yeasts but fungicidal effects against molds. The molecular basis for this difference remained unknown. The sequence of enzymatic steps required for ergosterol biosynthesis is different in yeasts and molds. Here we show that the azole-induced synthesis of fungicidal cell wall carbohydrate patches in the pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus strictly correlates with the accumulation of the CYP51 substrate eburicol. A lack of other essential ergosterol biosynthesis enzymes, such as sterol C24-methyltransferase (Erg6A), squalene synthase (Erg9) or squalene epoxidase (Erg1) does not result in comparable cell wall alterations. Partial repression of Erg6A, which converts lanosterol into eburicol, increases azole resistance. The sterol C5-desaturase (ERG3)-dependent conversion of eburicol into 14-methylergosta-8,24(28)-dien-3{beta},6-diol, the \"toxic diol\" responsible for the antifungal effects of azoles in yeasts, is not required for the fungicidal effects in A. fumigatus. In contrast to yeast, where a lack of ERG3 functionality causes azole resistance, A. fumigatus lacking ERG3 becomes more azole susceptible. Mutants lacking mitochondrial complex III functionality, which are less susceptible to the fungicidal effects of azoles, but get strongly inhibited in growth, convert eburicol much more efficiently into the supposedly \"toxic diol\". Our results support a mechanistic model where the mode of action of azoles against the pathogenic mold A. fumigatus, other than in yeast, relies on the accumulation of eburicol which exerts fungicidal effects by triggering the formation of cell wall carbohydrate patches.",

A deeper understanding of how an antibiotics mechanism of action influences the emergence of resistance would aid in the design of new drugs and help to preserve the effectiveness of existing ones. To this end, we developed a model that links bacterial population dynamics with antibiotic-target binding kinetics. Our approach allows us to derive mechanistic insights on drug activity from population-scale experimental data and to quantify the interplay between drug mechanism and resistance selection. We find that whether a drug acts as a bacteriostatic or bactericidal agent has little influence on resistance selection. We also show that heterogeneous drug-target binding within a population enables resistant bacteria to evolve fitness-improving secondary mutations even when drug doses remain above the resistant strains minimum inhibitory concentration. Our work suggests that antibiotic doses beyond this \"secondary mutation selection window\" could safeguard against the emergence of high-fitness resistant strains during treatment.', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a medically important bacteria due to its ability to form biofilm and is also an opportunistic pathogen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the intrinsic ability to form biofilm as one of the defense mechanisms for their survival. The fact that it can form biofilms on various medical implants makes it more harmful clinically. Although various antibiotics are used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, previous studies have shown that sub-MIC levels of antibiotics cause biofilm formation in this type of bacteria. The present study thus deals with the effect of the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin on the biofilm dynamics of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3. Biofilm formation was seen to be increasing with increased gentamicin concentrations in growth media. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy accompanied with other biochemical tests deduced that biofilm-forming components like exoproteins, eDNA, and exolipids as exopolymeric substances in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were increased in the presence of gentamicin. An increase in reactive oxygen species generation along with increased cell surface hydrophobicity was also seen in both strains when treated with gentamicin. The observed increase in the adherence of the cells accompanied by an increase in exopolymeric substances, eDNA, and exolipids may have largely contributed to the increased biofilm production by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3 under the stress of the antibiotic treatment.', 'Pathogenic fungi are a cause of growing concern. Developing an efficient and safe antifungal is challenging because of the similar biological properties of fungal and host cells. Consequently, there is an urgent need to better understand the mechanisms underlying antifungal resistance to prolong the efficacy of current molecules. A major step in this direction would be to be able to predict or even prevent the acquisition of resistance. We leverage the power of experimental evolution to quantify the diversity of paths to resistance to the antifungal 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), commercially known as flucytosine. We generated hundreds of independent 5-FC resistant mutants derived from two genetic backgrounds from wild isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through automated pin-spotting, whole-genome and amplicon sequencing, we identified the most likely causes of resistance for most strains. Approximately a third of all resistant mutants evolved resistance through a pleiotropic drug response, a potentially novel mechanism in response to 5-FC, marked by cross-resistance to fluconazole. These cross-resistant mutants are characterized by a loss of respiration and a strong tradeoff in drug-free media. For the majority of the remaining two thirds, resistance was acquired through loss-of-function mutations in FUR1, which encodes an important enzyme in the metabolism of 5-FC. We describe conditions in which mutations affecting this particular step of the metabolic pathway are favored over known resistance mutations affecting a step upstream, such as the well-known target cytosine deaminase encoded by FCY1. This observation suggests that ecological interactions may dictate the identity of resistance hotspots.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDetermining the paths evolution takes to make microbes resistant to antimicrobials is key to drug stewardship. Flucytosine is one of the oldest antifungals available. It is often used to treat cryptococcal infections. However, despite decades of use in the clinic, some details of its metabolism and of the mechanisms of resistance evolution still elude us. Flucytosine resistance is most often acquired specifically by inactivating a gene essential for the activation of this prodrug. We show that among many paths possible, one is overrepresented and involves a diversity of mutations that prevent enzyme expression or its activity. This path is preferred because these mutations also protect from the activation of the prodrug by non-mutant cells. A second, less frequent path to resistance, putatively involves a generalized response, which leads to fungal cells having an increased efflux capacity. The same mutants end up being resistant to the distinct and most widely used antifungal fluconazole. Our results show that the paths followed by evolution are influenced by microecological conditions and that resistance to unrelated drugs can emerge from the same mutations.']",

         "['The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors. The datasets, analyses, and tools presented here will enable the generation of testable hypotheses about the cell and organ-specific function of genes in diverse biological contexts.', 'Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.']",

Here, we show that Hsp47 enhances neuronal GABAA receptor functional surface expression, acting after Binding immunoglobulin Protein (BiP) to preferentially bind the folded conformation of GABAA receptors. Therefore, Hsp47 promotes the subunit-subunit interaction, the receptor assembly process, and the anterograde trafficking of GABAA receptors.

We previously found that the immediate early gene Nr4a1 is epigenetically activated by cocaine in mouse brain reward regions. HPTMs act combinatorically, yet few studies examine multiple HPTMs at a single gene. Bivalent gene promoters are simultaneously enriched in both activating (H3K4me3 (K4)) and repressive (H3K27me3 (K27)) HPTMs. As such, bivalent genes are lowly expressed but poised for activity-dependent gene regulation. In the current study, we defined regulation of K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 following cocaine treatment in male and female mice. The inclusion of female mice can shed light on the epidemiological relevance of sex to cocaine use disorder.\n\nMETHODSMale and female mice were injected with saline or cocaine (i.p. 20mg/kg). We applied sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR to define Nr4a1 bivalency and expression in striatum (STR), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus (HPC). Pearsons correlation matrices quantified relationships within each brain region across treatment conditions for each sex.\n\nRESULTSWe defined K4&K27 bivalency at the Nr4a1 promoter in all three brain regions, in both sexes. In female STR, cocaine increased Nr4a1 mRNA, coupled to maintenance of Nr4a1 K4&K27 bivalency. In male STR, cocaine enriched repressive H3K27me3 and K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 and failed to increase Nr4a1 mRNA. Furthermore, cocaine epigenetically regulated a putative NR4A1 target, Cartpt, in male PFC.\n\nCONCLUSIONThis study defined the epigenetic regulation of Nr4a1 in reward brain regions in male and female mice. Cocaine treatment in female mice increased Nr4a1 mRNA in STR, but there was no change in Nr4a1 H3K27me3 or K4&K27 promoter bivalency. Following cocaine treatment in male mice, Nr4a1 mRNA did not change in STR, HPC, or PFC, and Nr4a1 H3K27me3 and K4&K27 promoter bivalency increased in the STR.",

Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions.

However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding.

         "The fluorinated thymidine analogue trifluridine (FTD) is a chemotherapeutic drug commonly used to treat cancer; however, the mechanism by which FTD induces cytotoxicity is not fully understood. In addition, the effect of gain-of-function (GOF) missense mutations of the TP53 gene (encoding p53), which promote cancer progression and chemotherapeutic drug resistance, on the chemotherapeutic efficacy of FTD is unclear. Here, we revealed the mechanisms by which FTD induced aberrant mitosis and contributed to cytotoxicity in both p53-null and p53-GOF missense mutant cells. In p53-null mutant cells, FTD induced DNA double-stranded breaks, single-stranded DNA accumulation, and the associated DNA damage repair responses during G2 phase. Nevertheless, FTD-induced DNA damage and the related responses were not sufficient to trigger strict G2/M checkpoint arrest. Thus, these features were carried over into mitosis, resulting in chromosome breaks and bridges, and subsequent cytokinesis failure. Improper mitotic exit eventually led to cell apoptosis, caused by the accumulation of extensive DNA damage and the presence of micronuclei encapsulated in the disrupted nuclear envelope. Upon FTD treatment, the behavior of the p53-GOF-missense-mutant, isogenic cell lines, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, was similar to that of p53-null mutant cells. Thus, our data suggest that FTD treatment overrode the effect on gene expression induced by p53-GOF mutants and exerted its anti-tumor activity in a manner that was independent of p53 function.",

         "['The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors. The datasets, analyses, and tools presented here will enable the generation of testable hypotheses about the cell and organ-specific function of genes in diverse biological contexts.', 'Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.']",

         "Over 80% of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) carry the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride ion channel at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of epithelial cells. F508del impairs CFTR folding causing it to be destroyed by endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Small molecule correctors, which act as pharmacological chaperones to divert CFTR-F508del from ERAD, are the primary strategy for treating CF, yet corrector development continues with only a rudimentary understanding of how ERAD targets CFTR-F508del. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to systematically identify the molecular machinery that underlies CFTR-F508del ERAD. Although the ER-resident ubiquitin ligase, RNF5 was the top E3 hit, knocking out RNF5 only modestly reduced CFTR-F508del degradation. Sublibrary screens in an RNF5 knockout background identified RNF185 as a redundant ligase, demonstrating that CFTR-F508del ERAD is highly buffered. Gene-drug interaction experiments demonstrated that correctors tezacaftor (VX-661) and elexacaftor (VX-445) stabilize sequential, RNF5-resistant folding states. We propose that binding of correctors to nascent CFTR-F508del alters its folding landscape by stabilizing folding states that are not substrates for RNF5-mediated ubiquitylation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTO_LIClinically effective small molecule cystic fibrosis (CF) correctors divert mutant CFTR molecules from ER-associated degradation (ERAD).

In addition, we anticipated that an external-reward intervention improves performance during a Go/No go task, especially in individuals with low task-induced motivation as indexed by low theta/ beta power ratios. High salience of stop signals enhanced stopping performance but there was no difference in responsivity to the salience intervention between participants with high and low EEG alpha power.

         "Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) antigen presentation underlies a wide range of immune responses in health and disease. However, how MHC-II antigen presentation is regulated by the peptide-loading catalyst HLA-DM (DM), its associated modulator, HLA-DO (DO), is incompletely understood. This is due largely to technical limitations: model antigen presenting cell (APC) systems that express these MHC-II peptidome regulators at physiologically variable levels have not been described. Likewise, computational prediction tools that account for DO and DM activities are not presently available. To address these gaps, we created a panel of single MHC-II allele, HLA-DR4-expressing APC lines that cover a wide range of DO:DM ratio states. Using a combined immunopeptidomic and proteomic discovery strategy, we measured the effects DO:DM ratios have on peptide presentation by surveying over 10,000 unique DR4-presented peptides. The resulting data provide insight into peptide characteristics that influence their presentation with increasing DO:DM ratios.

Most of this work has analyzed only the direct paths between two proteins of interest - excluding the vast majority of possible genotypes and evolutionary trajectories - and has considered only a single protein function, leaving unaddressed the genetic architecture of functional specificity and its impact on the evolution of new functions. Here we develop a new method based on ordinal logistic regression to directly characterize the global genetic determinants of multiple protein functions from 20-state combinatorial deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. We use it to dissect the genetic architecture and evolution of a transcription factors specificity for DNA, using data from a combinatorial DMS of an ancient steroid hormone receptors capacity to activate transcription from two biologically relevant DNA elements. We show that the genetic architecture of DNA recognition consists of a dense set of main and pairwise effects that involve virtually every possible amino acid state in the protein-DNA interface, but higher-order epistasis plays only a tiny role. Pairwise interactions enlarge the set of functional sequences and are the primary determinants of specificity for different DNA elements. They also massively expand the number of opportunities for single-residue mutations to switch specificity from one DNA target to another. By bringing variants with different functions close together in sequence space, pairwise epistasis therefore facilitates rather than constrains the evolution of new functions.', 'Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce alternative phenotypes in response to its environment of development, is an important mechanism for coping with variable environments. While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low - but significant - effect of strain x environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.', 'Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow in a myriad of experimental conditions such that researchers have the ability to investigate any number of genotypes, strains, environments, or the interaction thereof. However, studies of variation in the yeast transcriptome have been limited by the processing capabilities of available RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform for yeasts. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage \"the awesome power of yeast\" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time, and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since we use the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique samples in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here we report transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, growth rate, metabolic strategies, stress responses, etc. all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.']",

         "Structural neuroimaging data have been used to compute an estimate of the biological age of the brain (brain-age) which has been associated with other biologically and behaviorally meaningful measures of brain development and aging. The ongoing research interest in brain-age has highlighted the need for robust and publicly available brain-age models pre-trained on data from large samples of healthy individuals. To address this need we have previously released a developmental brain-age model. Here we expand this work to develop, empirically validate, and disseminate a pre-trained brain-age model to cover most of the human lifespan. To achieve this, we selected the best-performing model after systematically examining the impact of site harmonization, age range, and sample size on brain-age prediction in a discovery sample of brain morphometric measures from 35,683 healthy individuals (age range: 5-90 years; 53.59% female). The pre-trained models were tested for cross-dataset generalizability in an independent sample comprising 2,101 healthy individuals (age range: 8-80 years; 55.35% female) and for longitudinal consistency in a further sample comprising 377 healthy individuals (age range: 9-25 years; 49.87% female). This empirical examination yielded the following findings: (1) the accuracy of age prediction from morphometry data was higher when no site harmonization was applied; (2) dividing the discovery sample into two age-bins (5-40 years and 40-90 years) provided a better balance between model accuracy and explained age variance than other alternatives; (3) model accuracy for brain-age prediction plateaued at a sample size exceeding 1,600 participants. These findings have been incorporated into CentileBrain [https://centilebrain.org/#/brainAGE2], an open-science, web-based platform for individualized neuroimaging metrics.",

Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions. We hypothesized that ToM network brain connectivity could predict individual performance on false-belief tasks. We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

         "In the physicists perspective, epithelial tissues constitute an exotic type of active matter with non-linear properties reminiscent of amorphous materials. In the context of a circular proliferating epithelium, modeled by the quasistatic vertex model, we identify novel discrete tissue scale rearrangements, i.e. cellular flow avalanches, which are a form of collective cell movement. During the avalanches, the cellular trajectories are radial in the periphery and form a vortex in the core. After the onset of these avalanches, the epithelial area grows discontinuously. The avalanches are found to be stochastic, and their strength is determined by the density of cells in the tissue. Overall, avalanches regularize the spatial tension distribution along tissue. Furthermore, the avalanche distribution is found to obey a power law, with an exponent consistent with sheer induced avalanches in amorphous materials. To decipher the role of avalanches in organ development, we simulate epithelial growth of the Drosophila eye disc during the third instar using a computational model, which includes both signaling and mechanistic signalling. During the third instar, the morphogenetic furrow (MF), a [~]10 cell wide wave of apical area constriction propagates through the epithelium, making it a system with interesting mechanical properties. These simulations are used to understand the details of the growth process, the effect of the MF on the growth dynamics on the tissue scale, and to make predictions. The avalanches are found to depend on the strength of the apical constriction of cells in the MF, with stronger apical constriction leading to less frequent and more pronounced avalanches. The results herein highlight the dependence of simulated tissue growth dynamics on relaxation timescales, and serve as a guide for in vitro experiments.",

The accurate determination of binding affinities, essential for decoding PPIs, faces challenges due to the substantial time and financial costs involved in experimental and theoretical methods. This situation underscores the urgent need for more effective and precise methodologies for predicting binding affinity. Despite the abundance of research on PPI modeling, the field of quantitative binding affinity prediction remains underexplored, mainly due to a lack of comprehensive data.\\n\\nThis study seeks to address these needs by manually curating pairwise interaction labels on all available 3D structures of proteins complexes, with experimentally determined binding affinities, creating the largest dataset for structure-based pairwise protein interaction with binding affinity to date. Subsequently, we introduce \"ProAffinity-GNN\", a novel deep learning framework using protein language model and graph neural network (GNN) to improve the accuracy of prediction of structure-based protein-protein binding affinities. The evaluation results across several benchmark test sets demonstrate that ProAffinity-GNN not only outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy but also shows strong generalization capabilities.', 'Protein-RNA interactions play a critical role in many cellular processes and pathologies. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and {pi}-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are due to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer belong to the interface in the interolog, a phenomenon we term \"interface switching out\". We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarii of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.', 'Protein therapeutics play an important role in controlling the functions and activities of disease-causing proteins in modern medicine. Despite protein therapeutics having several advantages over traditional small-molecule therapeutics, further development has been hindered by drug complexity and delivery issues. However, recent progress in deep learning-based protein structure prediction approaches such as AlphaFold opens new opportunities to exploit the complexity of these macro-biomolecules for highly-specialised design to inhibit, regulate or even manipulate specific disease-causing proteins. Anti-CRISPR proteins are small proteins from bacteriophages that counter-defend against the prokaryotic adaptive immunity of CRISPR-Cas systems. They are unique examples of natural protein therapeutics that have been optimized by the host-parasite evolutionary arms race to inhibit a wide variety of host proteins. Here, we show that these Anti-CRISPR proteins display diverse inhibition mechanisms through accurate structural prediction and functional analysis. We find that these phage-derived proteins are extremely distinct in structure, some of which have no homologues in the current protein structure domain. Furthermore, we find a novel family of Anti-CRISPR proteins which are structurally homologous to the recently-discovered mechanism of manipulating host proteins through enzymatic activity, rather than through direct inference. Using highly accurate structure prediction, we present a wide variety of protein-manipulating strategies of anti-CRISPR proteins for future protein drug design.']",

In incubation experiments, where oxygen concentrations were resolved to the nanomolar range, we show that Nitrosopumilus maritimus produces oxygen (O2) and dinitrogen (N2). The pathway is not completely resolved, but it has nitric oxide as a key intermediate. Part of the oxygen produced is directly used for ammonia oxidation, while some accumulates in the surrounding environment.

In vent ecosystems such as hydrothermal plumes, microorganisms rely on reduced chemicals and gases in hydrothermal fluids to fuel primary production and form diverse and complex microbial communities. However, microbial interactions that drive these complex microbiomes remain poorly understood. Here, we use microbiomes from the Guaymas Basin hydrothermal system in the Pacific Ocean to shed more light on the key species in these communities and their interactions. We built metabolic models from metagenomically assembled genomes (MAGs) and infer possible metabolic exchanges and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events within the community. We highlight possible archaea-archaea and archaea-bacteria interactions and their contributions to robustness of the community. Cellobiose, D-Mannose 1-phosphate, O2, CO2, and H2S were among the most exchanged metabolites. Ten microbes, including eight bacteria and two archaea, were identified as key contributors. These microorganisms uniquely enhanced the metabolic capabilities of the community by donating metabolites that cannot be produced by any other community member. Archaea from the DPANN group stood out as key microbes, benefiting significantly from accepting metabolites from other members of the microbiome. Amino acids were the key auxotrophy driving metabolic interactions in the community. Finally, over 200 horizontal gene transfer events were predicted in the community, the majority of which were between Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Overall, our study provides key insights into the microbial interactions that drive community structure and organisation in complex hydrothermal plumes and deep-sea microbiomes.', 'Heterotrophic marine bacteria utilize and recycle dissolved organic matter (DOM), impacting biogeochemical cycles. It is currently unclear to what extent distinct DOM components can be utilized by different heterotrophic clades. Here, we ask how a natural microbial community from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea responds to different molecular classes of DOM. These molecular classes - peptides, amino acids, amino sugars, disaccharides, monosaccharides and organic acids - together comprise much of the biomass of living organisms, released upon their death as DOM. Bulk bacterial activity increased after 24-hours for all treatments relative to the control, while glucose and ATP uptake decreased or remained unchanged. The relative abundance of several bacterial families, assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, increased in some treatments: peptides promoted an increase in Pseudoalteromonadaceae, disaccharides promoted both Pseudoalteromonadaceae and Alteromonadaceae, and most other treatments were dominated by Vibrionaceae. While some results were consistent with recent laboratory-based studies, for example Pseudoalteromonadaceae favoring peptides, other clades behaved differently. Alteromonadaceae, for example, grew well in the lab on many substrates but dominated in seawater samples when disaccharides were added. These results highlight the diversity in DOM utilization among heterotrophic bacteria and complexities in the response of natural communities.\\n\\nImportanceThe marine DOM pool contains numerous molecular classes, which change depending on the phytoplankton species, environmental conditions and interactions with other microbes, viruses and predators. In turn, the availability of these macromolecular pools affects the composition and function of the whole microbial community. Tracing the path between different carbon sources to specific microbes is another step towards revealing the dynamic interaction between bacteria and the DOM pool. This is especially important in warm and oligotrophic marine systems (e.g., Eastern Mediterranean Sea) where nutrients are scarce and may therefore affect microbial activity and growth.', 'The Arctic Ocean is an oligotrophic ecosystem facing escalating threats of oil spills as ship traffic increases owing to climate change-induced sea ice retreat. Biostimulation is an oil spill mitigation strategy that involves introducing bioavailable nutrients to enhance crude oil biodegradation by endemic oil-degrading microbes. For bioremediation to offer a viable response for future oil spill mitigation in extreme Arctic conditions, a better understanding of the effects of nutrient addition on Arctic marine microorganisms is needed. Comprehensive population tracking of controlled oil-spill microcosms using cell counting and microbial biodiversity screening revealed a significant decline in community diversity together with changes in microbial community composition. These shifts were also indicative of changes in prevailing genomic traits as inferred from 16S rRNA taxonomy of resulting communities. In addition to well-recognized hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, differential abundance analysis highlighted significant enrichment of unexpected genera Lacinutrix, Halarcobacter and Candidatus Pseudothioglobus. These groups have not been associated with hydrocarbon biodegradation until now, even though genomes from closely related isolates confirm the potential for hydrocarbon metabolism. These findings broaden understanding of marine oil spill bioremediation and how Arctic marine microbiomes and their novel lineages can respond to nutrient biostimulation as a strategy for oil spill mitigation.\\n\\nImportanceA comprehensive characterization and understanding of the impact of marine bioremediation strategies in the Arctic is crucial for effectively managing oil contamination. Such understanding enables an evaluation of the ecological impacts associated with mitigation strategies to minimize negative effects on sensitive ecosystems. By introducing external nutrients into areas affected by spills, microbial growth can be stimulated, enhancing hydrocarbon degradation by naturally occurring oil-degrading microorganisms. This may include novel microbial groups in permanently cold Arctic waters, where fewer oil biodegradation studies have been performed. It is also important to consider how nutrient addition may affect endemic microbial communities after successful remediation has occurred in oil-contaminated zones. Promoting naturally occurring oil-degrading microorganisms may have significant implications on nutrient cycling and marine food webs, which are critical for sustaining the health and well-being of coastal Indigenous communities in northern latitudes.']",

         "In the Amazon Forest region, cattle pastures are the main land use subsequent to deforestation. This land-use change affects the soil microbial community and methane fluxes, shifting the soil from a methane sink to a source. Soil physical and chemical attributes are changed due to slash-and-burn processes, including an increased soil pH after forest-to-pasture conversion. Without amendments, the pasture soils can become acidic again resulting in many cases in soil degradation. Liming is a standard management practice to increase soil pH while decreasing Al3+ availability. Liming is important to recover these degraded lands and increase soil fertility, but its impact on soil methane cycling in tropical soils is unknown. Here we investigated the role of soil pH on methane uptake under high concentrations of the gas. The top layer of forest (pH 4.1) and adjacent pasture soils (pH 4.8) from the Eastern Amazon were subjected to liming treatment (final pH 5.8) and incubated with [~]10,000 ppm of 13CH4 for 24 days to label DNA with 13C. Soil DNA was evaluated with Stable Isotopic Probing (SIP-DNA), methanotrophic abundance was quantified (pmoA gene), and high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA was performed. Liming increased the methane uptake in both forest ([~]10%) and pasture ([~]25%) soils. Methanotrophs Methylocaldum sp. (type I) and Beijerinckaceae (type II) were identified to actively incorporate carbon from methane in limed pasture soils. In limed forest soils, Nitrososphaeraceae, Lysobacter sp., and Acidothermus sp. were identified as 13C-enriched taxa. The enrichment of the archaeal family Nitrososphaeraceae, known as ammonia oxidizers, is correlated with an increase of ammonia monooxygenase genes, which code for an enzyme complex with wide substrate specificity that can also perform methane oxidation. In conclusion, liming Amazonian pasture soils not only contributes to the fertility and recovery of degraded areas but also has the potential to improve the oxidation of methane at high concentrations of this gas.",

To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions. We hypothesized that ToM network brain connectivity could predict individual performance on false-belief tasks. We proposed an Explainable Convolutional Variational Auto-Encoder model using functional connectivity (FC) to predict individual performance on false-belief tasks and achieved 90% accuracy.', 'Cortical representations supporting many cognitive abilities emerge from underlying circuits comprised of several different cell types. However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

In the established protocol, the mean efficiency of chromosome extraction ranged from 70 to 100%. The average number of recorded metaphases per slide was between 9 to 15. In general, the most satisfactory results were obtained for embryos at 6 dpf and larvae at the age of up to 7 dph. In the 24 dpf group, chromosome isolation was possible without immersion in spindle poison, however; in successive developmental stages, the minimal immersion time exceeded 1.5 hours, regardless of chorionation. Immersion for 14 hours did not compromise the efficacy of chromosome isolation. In the current study, successful chromosome isolation was determined mainly by hypotonization conditions. Younger developmental stages generally require the shortest hypotonization times, whereas older larvae require longer hypotonization times. The optimal hypotonization period is 5-15 minutes for embryos at 24 dpf, 40 minutes for embryos at 4dpf, and 50-60 minutes for fish at 6 dpf-7 dph. The only exception was the 24 hpf group where only blastula cells were used. An additional overnight fixation step significantly enhanced chromosome quality and supported chromosome counting especially in the 24 dpf group. The quality and quantity of chromosome slides were also significantly determined by tissue type, and the slides prepared from heads (gill cells) produced the best results.",

This approach involves 1) modeling trait effects on individual demographic rates (growth, survival, and recruitment) as multidimensional performance surfaces that vary with individual size and environment and 2) integrating these effects into a population model to project population growth rates (i.e., fitness) as a function of traits and environment.

Wood density and specific leaf area had interactive effects on demographic performance, resulting in fitness landscapes with multiple peaks.\\nC_LIO_LIWith this approach it is now possible to empirically estimate the net effect of traits on fitness, leading to improved understanding of the selective forces that drive community assembly and permitting generalizable predictions of population and community dynamics in changing environments.\\nC_LI', 'Climates are changing rapidly, demanding equally rapid adaptation of natural populations. Whether sexual selection can aid such adaptation is under debate; while sexual selection should promote adaptation when individuals with high mating success are also best adapted to their local surroundings, the expression of sexually selected traits can incur costs. Here we asked what the demographic consequences of such costs may be once climates change to become harsher and the strength of natural selection increases. We investigated how an evolutionary history of strong postcopulatory sexual selection (sperm competition) affects male fertility under acute adult heat stress. Harnessing the empirical potential of long-term experimental evolution in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we assessed the thermal sensitivity of fertility (TSF) in replicated lines maintained for 68 generations under three alternative mating regimes manipulating the opportunity for sexual and natural selection. We find that males evolving under strong sexual selection suffer from increased TSF, and that male success in sperm competition (P2: sperm offense) is genetically correlated to increased TSF. Interestingly, females from the regime under strong sexual selection, who experienced relaxed selection on their own reproductive effort, had high fertility in benign settings but suffered increased TSF, like their brothers. This implies that female fertility and TSF evolved through genetic correlation with reproductive traits sexually selected in males. Paternal but not maternal heat stress reduced offspring fertility with no evidence for adaptive transgenerational plasticity among heat-exposed offspring, indicating that the observed effects may compound over generations. Our results suggest that trade-offs between fertility and traits increasing success in postcopulatory sexual selection can be revealed in harsh environments. This can put polyandrous species under increased risk during extreme heat waves expected under future climate change.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTHow will populations respond to a warming world? Of increasing concern are negative effects of elevated temperatures on fertility, which in many species are observed for temperatures substantially lower than the ones causing death. Incorporating knowledge on species-specific thermal fertility limits has improved estimates of current species ranges but renders a more pessimistic view of the potential for adaptive responses under climate change. Sexual selection is a process that can interact with thermal sensitivity of fertility and is strongest in males of polyandrous species, in which females mate multiply and sperm of multiple males compete for fertilization of female eggs. Therefore, males of polyandrous species often invest heavily in sperm competition. However, given finite resources, increased investment in sperm competition can come at an expense of other processes needed to maintain the integrity of the male germline, which when compromised can reduce fertility and offspring quality. How may such male investment, fuelled by sexual selection, affect species responses to climate warming? To address this question, we first evolved populations under different laboratory settings that independently manipulated the levels of natural and sexual selection. We exposed adults from these populations to acute heat stress and measured the fertility of males and females. We find that sexual selection on males leads to a fertility debt that is revealed under heat stress. This debt was also apparent in females, who themselves were not selected for increased reproductive investment. Thus, genes under sexual selection in males seems to have impaired fertility in both sexes under heat stress. Forecasts of species response to climate change that do not incorporate thermal fertility limits and sexual selection may therefore underestimate species vulnerability to increasing temperatures.', 'Abiotic environmental conditions play a key role in driving the size and shape of organisms. Quantifying environment-morphology relationships is important not only for understanding the fundamental processes driving phenotypic diversity within and among species (1), but also for predicting how species will respond to ongoing global change (2). Despite a clear set of expectations motivated by ecological theory (3), broad evidence in support of generalizable effects of abiotic conditions, such as temperature (4), on spatial and temporal intraspecific morphological variation has been limited. Using standardized data from over 250,000 captures of 105 landbird species, we assessed intraspecific shifts in bird morphology since 1989 while simultaneously measuring spatial morphological gradients across the North American continent. Across bird species, we found strong spatial and temporal trends in body size, with warmer temperatures associated with smaller body sizes both at more equatorial latitudes and in more recent years. The magnitude of these thermal effects varied both across and within species, with results suggesting it is the warmest, rather than the coldest, temperatures driving both spatial and temporal trends. Across elevation, we found that body size declines as relative wing length increases, likely due to the benefits that longer wings confer for flight in thin air environments.

In recent years, PARP inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefits, especially in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, acquired drug resistance and relapse is a major challenge. Therapies disrupting the spliceosome alter cancer transcriptomes and have shown potential to improve PARP inhibitor response. Indisulam (E7070) has been identified as a molecular glue that brings splicing factor RBM39 and DCAF15 E3 ubiquitin ligase in close proximity. Exposure to indisulam induces RBM39 proteasomal degradation through DCAF15-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent RNA splicing defects. In this study, we demonstrate that loss of RBM39 induces splicing errors in DNA damage repair genes in ovarian cancer, leading to increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib. Indisulam synergized with olaparib in multiple in vitro models of ovarian cancer regardless of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and improved olaparib response in mice bearing PARP inhibitor-resistant tumors. DCAF15 expression, but not BRCA1/2 mutational status, was essential for the synergy between indisulam and olaparib, suggesting that the combination therapy may benefit patients irrespective of their BRCA1/2 status. These findings demonstrate that combining RBM39 degraders and PARP inhibitors is a promising therapeutic approach to improving PARP inhibitor response in ovarian HGSC.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=74 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/524417v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4cccd5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be34aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e72b06org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b9c89d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG One Sentence SummaryWe identified a novel drug combination that may improve PARP inhibitor response and benefit a large group of ovarian cancer patients.",

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors. The datasets, analyses, and tools presented here will enable the generation of testable hypotheses about the cell and organ-specific function of genes in diverse biological contexts.', 'Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.']",

Exposure to fluctuating temperatures around an average of Topt are anticipated to increase either development time or metabolic rate.

This is a hallmark of most developing brain areas including the hippocampus, which in the adult brain, functions in integrating external inputs onto internal dynamics. Such developmental disengagement from external inputs is likely a fundamental step for the proper development of cognitive internal models. Despite its importance, the developmental timeline and circuit basis for this disengagement remain unknown. To address this issue, we have investigated the daily evolution of CA1 dynamics and underlying circuits during the first two postnatal weeks of mouse development using two-photon calcium imaging in non-anesthetized pups. We show that the first postnatal week ends with an abrupt shift in the representation of self-motion in CA1. Indeed, most CA1 pyramidal cells switch from activated to inhibited by self-generated movements at the end of the first postnatal week whereas the majority of GABAergic neurons remain positively modulated throughout this period. This rapid switch occurs within two days and follows the rapid anatomical and functional surge of local somatic GABAergic innervation. The observed change in dynamics is consistent with a two-population model undergoing a strengthening of inhibition. We propose that this abrupt developmental transition inaugurates the emergence of internal cognitive models.",

Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm, integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of spike-distance metrics, to dissect PV neurons contributions towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that suppressing PV neurons degrades cortical discrimination of dynamic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting via changes in rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing, over a wide range of time-scales. Our findings suggest that PV neurons play a critical role in enhancing cortical temporal coding and reducing cortical noise, thereby improving representations of dynamic stimuli in complex scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne impressive example of sensory perception by the brain is its ability to analyze complex scenes, e.g., following what a friend is saying at a party amongst other speakers. Although some humans can solve this problem with relative ease, it remains very difficult for humans with a variety of impairments, e.g., hearing impairments, ADHD, and autism. The brain mechanisms underlying complex scene analysis remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded neural activity in auditory cortex in a complex auditory scene. When we suppressed PV neuron activity in auditory cortex, cortical performance decreased, and the timing of cortical responses was degraded. Our findings suggest that PV neurons improve the brains ability to analyze complex scenes by enhancing the timing of cortical responses while reducing cortical noise.', 'Active neurons impact cell types with which they are functionally connected. Both activity and functional connectivity are heterogeneous across the brain, but the nature of their relationship is not known. Here we employ brain-wide calcium imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish to record spontaneous activity of >12,000 neurons in the forebrain. By classifying their activity and functional connectivity into three levels (high, medium, low), we find that highly active neurons have low functional connections and highly connected neurons are of low activity. Intriguingly, deploying the same analytical methods on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the resting state human brain, we uncover a similar relationship between activity and functional connectivity, that is, regions of high activity are non-overlapping with those of high connectivity. These findings reveal a previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved brain organizational principle that have implications for understanding disease states and designing artificial neuronal networks.']",

EVA serves various purposes such as predicting disasters and analyzing sports records. Herein, we extended the use of EVA to investigate the motility functions of nanoscale motor proteins in neurons of the living worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, move along microtubules anterogradely and retrogradely, respectively, to deliver the cargo-containing materials needed for the cells. Although the essential difference between the two motors could not be inferred from the mean velocity values, the return-level EVA plots obtained from the velocity data revealed a difference.

         "['A proteins genetic architecture - the set of causal rules by which its sequence produces its functions - also determines its possible evolutionary trajectories. Prior research has proposed that genetic architecture of proteins is very complex, with pervasive epistatic interactions that constrain evolution and make function difficult to predict from sequence. Most of this work has analyzed only the direct paths between two proteins of interest - excluding the vast majority of possible genotypes and evolutionary trajectories - and has considered only a single protein function, leaving unaddressed the genetic architecture of functional specificity and its impact on the evolution of new functions. Here we develop a new method based on ordinal logistic regression to directly characterize the global genetic determinants of multiple protein functions from 20-state combinatorial deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments. We use it to dissect the genetic architecture and evolution of a transcription factors specificity for DNA, using data from a combinatorial DMS of an ancient steroid hormone receptors capacity to activate transcription from two biologically relevant DNA elements. We show that the genetic architecture of DNA recognition consists of a dense set of main and pairwise effects that involve virtually every possible amino acid state in the protein-DNA interface, but higher-order epistasis plays only a tiny role. Pairwise interactions enlarge the set of functional sequences and are the primary determinants of specificity for different DNA elements. They also massively expand the number of opportunities for single-residue mutations to switch specificity from one DNA target to another. By bringing variants with different functions close together in sequence space, pairwise epistasis therefore facilitates rather than constrains the evolution of new functions.', 'Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce alternative phenotypes in response to its environment of development, is an important mechanism for coping with variable environments. While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low - but significant - effect of strain x environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.', 'Yeasts are naturally diverse, genetically tractable, and easy to grow in a myriad of experimental conditions such that researchers have the ability to investigate any number of genotypes, strains, environments, or the interaction thereof. However, studies of variation in the yeast transcriptome have been limited by the processing capabilities of available RNA sequencing techniques. Here we optimize a powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform for yeasts. This platform utilizes a combinatorial barcoding strategy to enable massively parallel RNA sequencing of hundreds of yeast genotypes or growth conditions at once. This method can be applied to most species or strains of yeast for a fraction of the cost of traditional scRNAseq approaches. Thus, our technology permits researchers to leverage \"the awesome power of yeast\" by allowing us to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time, and with no specialized equipment. The key to this method is that sequential barcodes are probabilistically appended to cDNA copies of RNA while the molecules remain trapped inside of each cell. Thus, the transcriptome of each cell is labeled with a unique combination of barcodes. Since we use the cell membrane as a container for this reaction, many cells can be processed together without the need to physically isolate them from one another in separate wells or droplets. Further, the first barcode in the sequence can be chosen intentionally to identify samples from different environments or genetic backgrounds, enabling multiplexing of hundreds of unique samples in a single experiment. In addition to greater multiplexing capabilities, our method also facilitates a deeper investigation of biological heterogeneity given its single-cell nature. For example, in the data presented here we report transcriptionally distinct cell states related to cell cycle, growth rate, metabolic strategies, stress responses, etc. all within clonal yeast populations grown in the same environment. Hence, our technology has two obvious and impactful applications for yeast research: the first is the general study of transcriptional phenotypes across many strains and environments, and the second is investigating cell-to-cell heterogeneity across the entire transcriptome.']",

It is still unknown how the TH state interacts with the circadian clock, another important regulator of energy metabolism. We addressed this question using a mouse model of hypothyroidism and performed circadian analyses. Low TH levels decreased locomotor activity, food intake, and body temperature mostly in the active phase. Concurrently, liver transcriptome profiling showed only subtle effects compared to elevated TH conditions. Comparative circadian transcriptome profiling revealed alterations in mesor, amplitude, and phase of transcript levels in the livers of low-TH mice. Genes associated with cholesterol uptake, biosynthesis, and bile acid secretion showed reduced mesor. Increased and decreased cholesterol levels in the serum and liver were identified, respectively. Combining data from low- and high-TH conditions allowed the identification of 516 genes with mesor changes as molecular markers of the liver TH state. These genes participate in many known TH-associated processes. We further explored these genes and created a unique expression panel that can assess liver TH state in a time-of-day dependent manner. Our findings suggest that the liver has a low TH state under physiological conditions. Circadian profiling reveals genes as potential markers of liver TH state in one-time point studies.",

         "['Skeletal muscle regeneration requires the highly coordinated cooperation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) with other cellular components. However, due to technical limitations, it remains unclear how MuSCs dynamically interact with non-myogenic cells, especially myeloid cells, in live animals. In this work, we developed a dual-laser multimodal nonlinear optical microscope platform to serve as an effective tool for studying the real-time interaction between MuSCs and non-myogenic cells during the early phase of muscle regeneration. Increased cell volume and mitochondrial mass, cell density, and myotube formation are indicative of MuSCs activation/growth, proliferation, and differentiation, respectively. Using 3D time-lapse imaging on live reporter mice containing both red fluorescence protein (RFP)-labeled macrophages and yellow fluorescence protein (YFP)-labeled MuSCs, and taking advantages of the autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), we monitored the real-time spatiotemporal interaction between RFP+ macrophages/RFP- non-myogenic cells and YFP+ muscle stem/progenitor cells during the activation and the proliferation stages of regeneration. Our results indicated that their cell-cell contact was transient in nature. By inhibiting macrophage infiltration, we further showed that direct cell-cell contact between macrophages and MuSCs was not required for early activation of MuSCs before the proliferation stage. However, decreased macrophage infiltration impeded the proliferation and differentiation of MuSCs and also led to intramuscular fibrosis. Besides, neutrophil depletion in the CCR2 deficient mice did not delay the initial growth of MuSCs. These findings provide a new perspective on myeloid cells role during muscle regeneration.', 'Cardiomyocytes undergo different metabolic changes during development and differentiation crucial for their maturation and adult function, such as contraction, growth and survival. Alterations of cardiac metabolism have been associated with multiple disease states and pathological hypertrophy. The shift in substrate preference can impair the stress response, but it may also have a role in cell growth and survival. Here, we evaluated the response of cardiomyocytes to the presence of exogenous lactate, an important metabolite for the fetal heart and cardiogenesis. Lactate-exposed mouse primary cardiomyocytes and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes quickly acquired a characteristic dedifferentiated phenotype, with enhanced proliferative capacity as determined by an increased expression of cell cycle (Ki67) and cytokinesis (Aurora-B) effectors. This effect was specific to cardiomyocytes and did not affect other heart cell populations (e.g. cardiac fibroblasts). Nevertheless, cardiac fibroblasts exposed to lactate promoted a pro-regenerative environment through the modulation of the release of cytokines (such as Fas, IL-13 or SDF1a). We characterized lactate-induced cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation through RNA-sequencing and gene expression analysis and identified increased expression of BMP10 (a TGF{beta} family protein involved in embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and stemness) and proteins associated to cell fate regulation (LIN28, TCIM) together with downregulation of cardiac maturation genes (GRIK1, DGKK). Bottom-up analysis suggested the phenotype promoted by lactate could be related to the activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. This finding indicated that, indeed, lactate may be a key player of hypoxic regenerative responses in the heart, as it usually accumulates as a result of glycolysis. In addition, ex vivo neonatal heart culture showed prolonged beating function and cardiac tissue integrity when culture media was supplemented with lactate. Thus, we conclude that lactate enhances cardiac proliferation by reprogramming cardiomyocytes towards a dedifferentiated stem cell-like state, supporting the notion that modulation of the metabolic microenvironment might be a powerful novel approach for promoting cardiac regeneration and tissue engineering applications.', 'Increased body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the underlying basis of these associations are unclear. In order to assess this, we studied how IR and associated inflammation in adipose tissue developed in the presence of increased body iron stores. Male hepcidin knock-out (Hamp1-/-) mice, which have increased body iron stores, and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 and 24 weeks. Development of IR and metabolic parameters linked to this, insulin signaling in tissue, and inflammation and iron-related parameters in visceral adipose tissue were studied in these animals. HFD-feeding resulted in impaired glucose tolerance in both genotypes of mice. In response to the HFD for 24 weeks, Hamp1-/- mice gained less body weight and developed less IR than corresponding WT mice. This was associated with less lipid accumulation in the liver and decreased inflammation and lipolysis in the adipose tissue in the knock-out mice, than in the WT animals. Fewer macrophages infiltrated the adipose tissue in the knockout mice than in wild-type mice, with these macrophages exhibiting a predominantly anti-inflammatory (M2-like) phenotype. These observations suggest a novel role of hepcidin (central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis) in the development of inflammation in adipose tissue and insulin resistance, in response to a high-fat diet.\\n\\nCLINICAL PERSPECTIVESO_LIElevated body iron stores and inflammation in adipose tissue have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Specifically, TCRanno found cytomegalovirus-specific TCRs in seronegative healthy individuals, supporting the possibility of abortive infections. TCRanno discovered age-accumulated fraction of SARS-CoV2-specific TCRs in pre-pandemic samples, which may explain the aggressive symptoms and age-related severity of COVID-19.

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).', 'Animals are integrated organ systems composed of interacting cells whose structure and function are in turn defined by their active genes. Understanding what distinguishes physiological and disease states therefore requires systemic knowledge of the gene activities that define the distinct cells that make up an animal. Towards this goal, this study reports the first single-cell resolution transcriptional atlas of a fertile multicellular organism: Caenorhabditis elegans. The scRNA-Seq compendium of wild-type young adult C. elegans comprises 159 distinct cell types with 18,033 genes expressed across cell types. Fewer than 300 of these genes are housekeeping genes as evidenced by their consistent expression across cell types and conditions, and by their basic and essential functions; 170 of these housekeeping genes are conserved across phyla. The 362 transcription factors with available ChIP-Seq data are linked to patterns of gene expression of different cell types. To identify potential interactions between cell types, we used the in silico tool cell2cell to predict molecular patterns reflecting both known and uncharacterized intercellular interactions across the C. elegans body. Finally, we present WormSeq (wormseq.org), a web interface that, among other functions, enables users to query gene expression across cell types, identify cell-type specific and potential housekeeping genes, analyze candidate ligand-receptors mediating communication between cells, and study promiscuous and cell-specific transcription factors. The datasets, analyses, and tools presented here will enable the generation of testable hypotheses about the cell and organ-specific function of genes in diverse biological contexts.', 'Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.']",

Progressing beyond these unnatural stimuli, brainstem responses to continuous speech presented via earphones have been recently detected using linear temporal response functions (TRFs). Here, we extend earlier studies by measuring subcortical responses to continuous speech presented in the sound-field, and assess the amount of data needed to estimate brainstem TRFs. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 24 normal hearing participants while they listened to clicks and stories presented via earphones and loudspeakers. Subcortical TRFs were computed after accounting for non-linear processing in the auditory periphery by either stimulus rectification or an auditory nerve model. Our results demonstrated that subcortical responses to continuous speech could be reliably measured in the sound-field. TRFs estimated using auditory nerve models outperformed simple rectification, and 16 minutes of data was sufficient for the TRFs of all participants to show clear wave V peaks for both earphones and sound-field stimuli. Subcortical TRFs to continuous speech were highly consistent in both earphone and sound-field conditions, and with click ABRs. However, sound-field TRFs required slightly more data (16 minutes) to achieve clear wave V peaks compared to earphone TRFs (12 minutes), possibly due to effects of room acoustics. By investigating subcortical responses to sound-field speech stimuli, this study lays the groundwork for bringing objective hearing assessment closer to real-life conditions, which may lead to improved hearing evaluations and smart hearing technologies.",

Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance. We trained our proposed model using Static Functional Connectivity (SFC) and Inter-Subject Functional Correlations (ISFC) matrices separately. We observed that the stimulus-driven feature set (ISFC) could capture ToM and Pain brain states more accurately with an average accuracy of 94%, whereas it achieved 85% accuracy using SFC matrices. We also validated our results using five-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92%. Besides this study, we applied the SHAP approach to identify neurobiological brain fingerprints that contributed the most to predictions.

However, cell type-specific contributions to rate and timing-based cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations. PV neurons play a fundamental role in balancing excitation and inhibition in cortex and sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based coding, and the robustness of temporal representations to spatial competition, has not been investigated.

Molecular dynamics simulations revealed, that the positively charged helical C-terminus of melittin anchors rapidly into the hydrophilic head-group region of KLA, while the flexible N-terminus makes contacts with the phosphate groups of KLA moving melittin into the boundary between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the lipids. Electrochemical techniques confirmed binding of melittin to the model membrane. To probe the peptide conformation and orientation during interaction with the membrane, polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy was used. The measurements revealed conformational changes in the peptide accompanied by reorientation and translocation of the peptide at the membrane surface.

Despite the abundance of research on PPI modeling, the field of quantitative binding affinity prediction remains underexplored, mainly due to a lack of comprehensive data.\\n\\nThis study seeks to address these needs by manually curating pairwise interaction labels on all available 3D structures of proteins complexes, with experimentally determined binding affinities, creating the largest dataset for structure-based pairwise protein interaction with binding affinity to date. Subsequently, we introduce \"ProAffinity-GNN\", a novel deep learning framework using protein language model and graph neural network (GNN) to improve the accuracy of prediction of structure-based protein-protein binding affinities. The evaluation results across several benchmark test sets demonstrate that ProAffinity-GNN not only outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy but also shows strong generalization capabilities.', 'Protein-RNA interactions play a critical role in many cellular processes and pathologies. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and {pi}-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are due to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer belong to the interface in the interolog, a phenomenon we term \"interface switching out\". We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarii of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.', 'Protein therapeutics play an important role in controlling the functions and activities of disease-causing proteins in modern medicine. Despite protein therapeutics having several advantages over traditional small-molecule therapeutics, further development has been hindered by drug complexity and delivery issues. However, recent progress in deep learning-based protein structure prediction approaches such as AlphaFold opens new opportunities to exploit the complexity of these macro-biomolecules for highly-specialised design to inhibit, regulate or even manipulate specific disease-causing proteins. Anti-CRISPR proteins are small proteins from bacteriophages that counter-defend against the prokaryotic adaptive immunity of CRISPR-Cas systems. They are unique examples of natural protein therapeutics that have been optimized by the host-parasite evolutionary arms race to inhibit a wide variety of host proteins. Here, we show that these Anti-CRISPR proteins display diverse inhibition mechanisms through accurate structural prediction and functional analysis. We find that these phage-derived proteins are extremely distinct in structure, some of which have no homologues in the current protein structure domain. Furthermore, we find a novel family of Anti-CRISPR proteins which are structurally homologous to the recently-discovered mechanism of manipulating host proteins through enzymatic activity, rather than through direct inference. Using highly accurate structure prediction, we present a wide variety of protein-manipulating strategies of anti-CRISPR proteins for future protein drug design.']",

         "SummaryIn many modern bioinformatics applications, such as statistical genetics, or single-cell analysis, one frequently encounters datasets which are orders of magnitude too large for conventional in-memory analysis. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SIMBSIG, a highly scalable Python package which provides a scikit-learn-like interface for out-of-core, GPU-enabled similarity searches, principal component analysis, and clustering. Due to the PyTorch backend it is highly modular and particularly tailored to many data types with a particular focus on biobank data analysis.\n\nAvailabilitySIMBSIG is freely available from PyPI and its source code and documentation can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/simbsig) under a BSD-3 license.\n\nContactmichael.adamer@bsse.ethz.ch",

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions.

         "Metastasis of Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major cause of death in patients. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an important transcription factor involved in the initiation and progression of lung cancer. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a serine/threonine kinase, is an oncogene that promotes the malignancy of multiple cancer types. Nonetheless, the interaction between these two factors and significance in lung cancer remains to be determined. Here, we demonstrate that PLK1 phosphorylates AHR at S489 in LUAD, which leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastatic events. RNA-seq analyses show that type 2 deiodinase (DIO2) is responsible for EMT and enhanced metastatic potential. DIO2 converts tetraiodothyronine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), which then activates thyroid hormone signaling. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that treatment with T3 or T4 promotes the metastasis of LUAD, whereas depletion of DIO2 or deiodinase inhibitor disrupts this property. Taken together, our results identify the phosphorylation of AHR by PLK1 as a mechanism leading to the progression of LUAD and provide possible therapeutic interventions for this event.",

Circadian variation in performance on spatial memory tasks is well-documented; however, the effect of sex across circadian time remains unclear. Additionally, little is known regarding the impact of time-of-day on hippocampal neuronal physiology. Here, we investigated the influence of both sex and time-of-day on hippocampal neurophysiology and memory.\n\nPerformance on the object location memory (OLM) task depended on both circadian time and sex, with memory enhanced at night in males but during the day in females. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) magnitude at CA3-CA1 synapses was greater at night compared to day in both sexes. Next, we measured spontaneous synaptic excitation and inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Frequency and amplitude of inhibition was greater during the day compared to night, regardless of sex. Frequency and amplitude of excitation was larger in females, compared to males, independent of time-of-day, although both time-of-day and sex influenced presynaptic release probability. At night, CA1 pyramidal neurons showed enhanced excitability (action potential firing and/or baseline potential) that was dependent on synaptic excitation and inhibition, regardless of sex. This study emphasizes the importance of sex and time-of-day in hippocampal physiology, especially given that many neurological disorders impacting the hippocampus are linked to circadian disruption and present differently in men and women. Knowledge about how sex and circadian rhythms affect hippocampal physiology can improve the translational relevancy of therapeutics and inform the appropriate timing of existing treatments.",

Deep learning provides an important platform for analyzing brain signals at different developmental stages to understand brain dynamics. Due to their internal architecture and feature extraction techniques, existing machine learning and deep-learning approaches for fMRI-based brain decoding must improve classification performance and explainability. The existing approaches also focus on something other than the behavioral traits that can tell about individuals variability in behavioral traits. In the current study, we hypothesized that even at the early childhood stage (as early as 3 years), connectivity between brain regions could decode brain tasks and predict behavioural performance in false-belief tasks. To this end, we proposed an explainable deep learning framework to decode brain states (Theory of Mind and Pain states) and predict individual performance on ToM-related false-belief tasks in a developmental dataset. We proposed an explainable spatiotemporal connectivity-based Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Ex-stGCNN) model for decoding brain tasks. Here, we consider a dataset (age range: 3-12 yrs and adults, samples: 155) in which participants were watching a short, soundless animated movie, \"Partly Cloudy,\" that activated Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and pain networks. After scanning, the participants underwent a ToMrelated false-belief task, leading to categorization into the pass, fail, and inconsistent groups based on performance.

Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli which are highly dynamic in time and compete with stimuli at other spatial locations.

However, there is little evidence indicating that the cognitive benefits of playing action video games generalize from simplified unisensory stimuli to naturalistic multisensory scenes - a fundamental characteristic of natural, everyday life environments. In particular, it is unknown whether video game experience has an impact on cross-modal congruence effects when searching through such multisensory scenes. The present pre-registered compared the performance of action video game players (AVGPs) with non-video game players (NVGPs) on a visual search task for objects embedded in video clips of realistic scenes. We run two identical online experiments with gender-balanced samples, for a total N=130. Overall, the data replicated previous findings reporting search benefits when visual targets were accompanied by semantically congruent auditory events, compared to neutral or incongruent ones. However, according to the results, AVGPs did not consistently outperform NVGPs in the search task overall, nor they exploit multisensory cues more efficiently than NVGPs. Exploratory analyses with self-reported gender as a variable revealed a potential difference in response strategy between experienced male and female AVGPs when dealing with cross-modal cues. These findings suggest that the generalization of the advantage of AVG experience to realistic, cross-modal situations should be done with caution, and considering gender-related aspects.",

However, it remains unclear how heritable the microbiome is with respect to the host plant genotype and to what extent host genetic mechanisms can modulate plant-microbe interactions in the face of environmental stress. Here, we surveyed the root and rhizosphere microbiome of 129 accessions of locally adapted Zea mays, sourced from diverse habitats and grown under control and different stress conditions. We quantified treatment and host genotype effects on the microbiome. Plant genotype and source environment were predictive of microbiome composition. Genome wide association analysis identified host genetic variants linked to both rhizosphere microbiome composition and source environment. We identified transposon insertions in a candidate gene linked to both the abundance of a keystone microbe Massilia and source total soil nitrogen, finding mutant plants to show a reduction in lateral root density. We conclude that locally adapted maize varieties exert patterns of genetic control on their root and rhizosphere microbiomes that follow variation in their home environments, consistent with a role in tolerance to prevailing stress.', 'Associations with soil microorganisms are crucial for plants overall health and functioning. While much work has been done to understand drivers of rhizosphere microbiome structure and function, the relative importance of geography, climate, soil properties, and plant genetics remains unclear, as results have been mixed and comprehensive studies across many sites and genotypes are limited. Rhizosphere microbiomes are crucial for crop resistance to pathogens, stress tolerance, nutrient availability, and ultimately yield. Here we quantify the relative roles of plant genotype, environment, and their interaction in shaping soil rhizosphere communities, using 16S and ITS gene sequencing of rhizosphere soils from 10 common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) genotypes from 15 sites across the Great Plains of the United States. While site generally outweighed genotype overall in terms of effects on archaeal, bacterial and fungal richness, community composition, and taxa relative abundances, there was also a significant interaction such that genotype exerted a significant influence on archaeal, bacterial and fungal microbiomes in certain sites. Site effects were attributed to a combination of spatial distance and differences in climate and soil properties. Microbial taxa that were previously associated with resistance to the fungal necrotrophic pathogen Sclerotinia were present in most sites but differed significantly in relative abundance across sites. Our results have implications for plant breeding and agronomic microbiome manipulations for agricultural improvement across different geographic regions.\\n\\nImportanceDespite the importance of plant breeding in agriculture, we still have a limited understanding of how plant genetic variation shapes soil microbiome composition across broad geographic regions. Using 15 sites across the Great Plains of North America, we show that cultivated sunflower rhizosphere archaeal, bacterial and fungal communities are driven primarily by site soil and climatic differences, but that genotype can interact with site to influence composition, especially in warmer and drier sites with lower overall microbial richness. We also show that all taxa that were previously found to be associated with resistance to the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were widespread but significantly affected by site, while a subset were also significantly affected by genotype. Our results contribute to a broader understanding of rhizosphere archaeal, bacterial and fungal community assembly, and provide foundational knowledge for plant breeding efforts and potential future microbiome manipulations in agriculture.', 'Plant secondary metabolites that are released into the rhizosphere alter biotic and abiotic soil properties, which in turn affect the performance of other plants. How such plant-soil feedbacks affect agricultural productivity and food quality in crop rotations is unknown. Here, we assessed the impact of maize benzoxazinoids on the performance, yield and food quality of three winter wheat varieties in a two-year field experiment. Following maize cultivation, we detected benzoxazinoid-dependent chemical and microbial fingerprints in the soil. The chemical fingerprint was still visible during wheat growth, while the microbial fingerprint was no longer detected. Benzoxazinoid soil conditioning by wild-type maize led to increased wheat emergence, tillering, growth and biomass compared to soil conditioning by bx1 mutant plants. Weed cover remained unaffected, while insect damage decreased in a subset of varieties. Wheat yield was increased by over 4% without a reduction in grain quality across varieties. This improvement was directly associated with increased germination and tillering. Taken together, our experiments demonstrate that plant secondary metabolites can increase yield via plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions. If this phenomenon holds across different soils and environmental conditions, optimizing plant root exudation could be a powerful, genetically tractable strategy to enhance crop yields without additional inputs.']",

         "Blood endothelial cells control the hemostatic and inflammatory response by secreting von Willebrand factor (VWF) and P-selectin from storage organelles called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB). Actin-associated motor proteins regulate this secretory pathway at multiple points. Prior to fusion, myosin Va forms a complex that anchors WPBs to peripheral actin structures allowing maturation of content. Post-fusion, an actomyosin ring/coat is recruited and compresses to forcibly expel the largest VWF multimers. Here we provide the first evidence for the involvement of class I myosins during regulated VWF secretion. We show that unconventional myosin-1C (Myo1c) is recruited post fusion via its pleckstrin homology domain in an actin-independent process providing a link between the actin ring and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the membrane of the fused organelle. This is necessary to ensure maximal VWF secretion in response to secretagogue stimulation. Inhibition of class I myosins using the inhibitor Pentachloropseudilin alters the kinetics of the exocytic actin ring. These data offer new insight into the control of an essential physiological process and provide a new potential way in which it might be therapeutically controlled.\n\nSIGNFICANCE STATEMENTMyosin motors play diverse roles in regulated secretion. In endothelial cells, the role of conventional myosins (e.g. non-muscle myosin II) are well described however little is known about the requirement of unconventional myosins. Our data identify an important function of the class 1 myosin, Myosin-1C, in the actomyosin mediated expulsion of an essential blood clotting factor (von Willebrand factor) from endothelial cells. This is the first description of how class 1 myosins contribute to primary hemostasis and is therefore greatly improves our understanding of a fundamental physiological process.",

         "['Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for understanding biological processes and disease mechanisms, contributing significantly to advances in protein engineering and drug discovery. The accurate determination of binding affinities, essential for decoding PPIs, faces challenges due to the substantial time and financial costs involved in experimental and theoretical methods. This situation underscores the urgent need for more effective and precise methodologies for predicting binding affinity. Despite the abundance of research on PPI modeling, the field of quantitative binding affinity prediction remains underexplored, mainly due to a lack of comprehensive data.\\n\\nThis study seeks to address these needs by manually curating pairwise interaction labels on all available 3D structures of proteins complexes, with experimentally determined binding affinities, creating the largest dataset for structure-based pairwise protein interaction with binding affinity to date. Subsequently, we introduce \"ProAffinity-GNN\", a novel deep learning framework using protein language model and graph neural network (GNN) to improve the accuracy of prediction of structure-based protein-protein binding affinities. The evaluation results across several benchmark test sets demonstrate that ProAffinity-GNN not only outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy but also shows strong generalization capabilities.', 'Protein-RNA interactions play a critical role in many cellular processes and pathologies. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and {pi}-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are due to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer belong to the interface in the interolog, a phenomenon we term \"interface switching out\". We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarii of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.', 'Protein therapeutics play an important role in controlling the functions and activities of disease-causing proteins in modern medicine. Despite protein therapeutics having several advantages over traditional small-molecule therapeutics, further development has been hindered by drug complexity and delivery issues. However, recent progress in deep learning-based protein structure prediction approaches such as AlphaFold opens new opportunities to exploit the complexity of these macro-biomolecules for highly-specialised design to inhibit, regulate or even manipulate specific disease-causing proteins. Anti-CRISPR proteins are small proteins from bacteriophages that counter-defend against the prokaryotic adaptive immunity of CRISPR-Cas systems. They are unique examples of natural protein therapeutics that have been optimized by the host-parasite evolutionary arms race to inhibit a wide variety of host proteins. Here, we show that these Anti-CRISPR proteins display diverse inhibition mechanisms through accurate structural prediction and functional analysis. We find that these phage-derived proteins are extremely distinct in structure, some of which have no homologues in the current protein structure domain. Furthermore, we find a novel family of Anti-CRISPR proteins which are structurally homologous to the recently-discovered mechanism of manipulating host proteins through enzymatic activity, rather than through direct inference. Using highly accurate structure prediction, we present a wide variety of protein-manipulating strategies of anti-CRISPR proteins for future protein drug design.']",
