# Introduction
The goal of this file is to document what has been done so far in my *Stage en méthodes computationnelles* under the supervision of Louis Renaud-Desjardins. Mainly, you will find in this file explanation of methodological choices for our work and the main results we got so far. 

Special thanks to François Claveau, Pierre-Olivier Méthot, Louis Renaud-Desjardins, Aurélien Goutsmedt, Thomas Pradeu and Maël Lemoine for their support on this projet.

/****** Fetching relevant corpora
Project: Biology in philosophy
created by Jacob Hamel-Mottiez and Louis Renaud-Desjarding on 2024-09-23. 

// SETUP //
We run many tests on SQL Server. The cleanest data output is when you execute 
the query, right-click on the result and save it as a .csv file. 

You can easily save on onedrive and fetch the data elsewhere

// DATA STRUCTURE //
We are working with Web of Science (clarivate) database via Albator. The
access is provided
by Vincent Lariviere.

All the information linking cited and citing documents is established via a key called "OST_BK" which is an unique identifier. 

There are two ways ways in which you can deal with the data. 
  1) Take the .dbo which is from WoS ;  
  2) Take the .pex which is from OST. 

What should influence your choice is the following methodological considerations : 
The table that links the cited documents with the citing documents is constructed as follow :   
  1) The cited document must be present in the WOS (Web of Science) corpus.
  2) The cited document must be an article, a note, or a review (with a `code_document` less than 4).
  3) The documents citing or cited must have been published between 1900 and the present day.
  4) The documents citing or cited must have at least one author listed in the `summary_name` table.

In short, if you want all the documents cited for a given citing journal, take .dbo. If you only want the scientific articles, then take .pex because it is cleaner. 


// COMPLETNESS OF THE DATA //
When looking at B&P (Code_Revue = 2229), we were able to fetch a total of 67 774 cited documents. 
When we looked at which got a Cited_Title, it dropped to 43 828.
When we looked at which had a Cited_Title and an OST_BK, it dropped to 36 335 (~ 31 436 lost in total).

# Comparing three databases : Web of Science and Scopus.
Early in our work came a methodological choice. Namely, choosing between two well known databases : Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. 
**We chose to go with Scopus**. In summary, the choice was made based on two main reasons. 

1.Scopus has a wider range of coverage when it comes to the journals we want to investigate, that is the main journals of philosophy of biology. For example, it covers *Biological Theory*, which is absent of our Web of Science database. 

2. Web of Science for philosophy is missing many citing to cited document link. 

If you want in depth details about both databases and their strenghts and weaknesses given our corpus, follow along. If you want to see the results, you can skip the next section. 

## *Biology & Philosophy* across different databases : Springer, Web of Science and Scopus. 
Here is how we fetch the information from the different databases. 

- For Springer, we looked manually at each volume and create an excel sheet with the number of articles per year.

- For Web of Science we fetched the data through the Albator database which we got access to via the OST. The detailed information about the SQL query already provided earlier. 

- For Scopus, we used  Scopus API and the *rscopus* package to get our data. See the code below for the specific workflow. 


``` r
bio_philo_query <- rscopus::scopus_search("EXACTSRCTITLE(Biology and Philosophy)", 
                                     view = "COMPLETE",
                                     headers = insttoken)

bio_philo_raw <- gen_entries_to_df(bio_philo_query$entries)
```




``` r
bio_philo_papers <- read_csv(paste0(dir_od, "bio_philo_papers.csv"))
bio_philo_affiliations <- read_csv(paste0(dir_od, "bio_philo_affiliations.csv"))
bio_philo_authors <- read_csv(paste0(dir_od, "bio_philo_authors.csv"))
citing_articles <- bio_philo_papers$`dc:identifier` # extracting the IDs of our articles
```

Let's start by making sure that we have a good coverage for articles.  










Lets look at the total number of articles from each database for *Biology & Philosophy*. Unsuprisingly, the number of article listed in Springer are more numerous than in the other databases. At first sight, Web of Science seems to have a better coverage, with a difference of more than 200 articles when compared to Scopus. 


``` r
#Table

fct_DT(
  art_all |>
  group_by(FROM) |>
  summarise(total_N = sum(N)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_N))
)
```

```

Lets look at the distribution of those articles since the beginning of *Biology & Philosophy*. We see that 1) Web of Science has a good coverage except for early and recent years of *B&P* whereas Scopus do pretty well in the same range. However, Scopus seems to lose a lot of articles from the decade 1995-2005. However, when we filter only on articles, Scopus gets actually a better coverage overall.

# Coverage of references
Now that we have a better idea of the articles we are able to get from both databases, lets look at their references. 

However, a big problem is the references of those articles. For our following work, these references will be crucial, especially for cocitation network. Indeed, we uncover that many many references had no unique identifier (around 1/3 to potentially 1/2). 


This is especially problematic. Here is some quantitative data : 

  1) We have a total of 67 774 cited document for our B&P corpus. 
  2) 43 828 cited document have a Cited_Title (~ 24 000 lost already).
  3) 31 439 cited document have Cited_Title and/or an OST_BK_Ref (the OST_BK or unique identifier for a cited document, see "Cited authors (references' authors)" section of the SQL script above). 

  

``` r
# Completeness of data -----------------------------------------------------
df <- tibble(ref_bp) |> mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ na_if(., "NULL")))

df <-  df|> rename(Citing_ID = OST_BK, Cited_ID = OST_BK_Ref, Cited_Year = Year)

# Create a tibble summarizing total rows, NA values, and non-NA values by column
summary_tibble <- tibble(
  column = names(df),
  total_rows = nrow(df),
  na_count = sapply(df, function(x)
    sum(is.na(x))),
  non_na_count = sapply(df, function(x)
    sum(!is.na(x)))
)

summary_tibble <-  summary_tibble |>  
  mutate(percent = non_na_count / total_rows *100) |> 
  mutate(across(percent, round, 3)) |>
  arrange(desc(percent))


summary_tibble <- summary_tibble |> 
  filter(column != "UID" & column != "UID_Ref")

summary_tibble$column <- factor(summary_tibble$column, levels = c("Citing_ID", "Cited_ID","Cited_Author", "Cited_Year", "Cited_Work", "Cited_Title"))
```



``` r
summary_tibble |> 
  hchart(type = "column", 
         hcaes(x = column, 
               y = percent,

## Scopus
Given the important limitations listed before, we turned ourselves to another database that looked promising : Scopus. 

We must thank Aurélien Goutsmedt which made us aware of an API given by Scopus. It eased out our work substantially (for more information, see his blog [here](https://aurelien-goutsmedt.com/post/extracting-biblio-data-1/). 

First, let's look at *Biology & Philosophy* in this new database to compare it to our results with Web of Science.


Here, compared to our WoS data, we get more than 68 800 references with close to 100% match between references and articles. As a reminder we had around 64 000 references when going through WoS and almost 1/3 of them had no link to their respective article.

# Scopus : Biological Theory
Another reason why it can be interesting to choose Scopus is when looking at its journal coverage. We looked at a journal that is not in WoS, but that was in Scopus : *Biological Theory* (BT). 

Let's look at the article we are able to fetch with Scopus API compared to the articles listed on Springer for the [journal](https://link.springer.com/journal/13752/volumes-and-issues). We created a .csv counting manually all the articles listed on Springer for BT and compared it with what we got with the API.












The first step is to compare the coverage between Springer and Scopus. As we see, both are pretty close Springer getting a little bit less than 60 article more than Scopus. 

``` r
#Table

fct_DT(
  art_all_BT |>
  group_by(FROM) |>
  summarise(total_N = sum(N)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_N))
)
```

```

When we look at the specific coverage for each year, we see that the coverage is pretty good. However, 2024 is a strange year where the coverage of Scopus is better than the one of Springer. We don't understand why at the moment.

As we see, the coverage in Scopus ressemble the one we get from Springer when it comes to articles. 

Now, let's look at the metadata of the references. For the journal *Biological Theory*, we get 35 793 references.  






As you remember, one issue with WoS was that many references had no link with their article. 
What about Scopus? The following graph shows promising results.



We have almost 100% non-na entries for a) Cited_Authors, b) Citing_ID, c) Cited_ID, d) Cited_Work which is either the article name or the book name. We should not be too bothered with the fact that the column Cited_Title as around 40% of NA entries since books do not have them typically. 

Something that can look more bothersome is the Cited_Year column 40% of NA values. Looking into it, we can easily understand why there is so many NAs.The main reason is because Scopus has done before hand cleaning, notably for books that have many editions. You can demonstrate this by fetching the data directly from Scopus website and compare it to what we get with the API.

Here, we see that the famous book by Richard Dawkins *The Selfish Gene* has been refered to with different publication years (i.e. 1976 ans 1989). It is also the case for Odling-Smee et al. which gets two different (extracted_year). If We look at the data from Scopus API we see that Dawkins book got no year attributed to it and that they many similar but different entries are under the same unique identifier (scopus_id). 


``` r
dawkins_tbl <- clean_references_th |> select(scopus_id, author, year, sourcetitle, title) |> filter(!is.na(scopus_id)) |> distinct() |> filter(scopus_id == "0004149207")
fct_DT(dawkins_tbl)
```

As we see, the completness of the metadata is comparable to what we got with B&P which is more than sufficient.

# Comparative results of *Biology & Philosophy* and *Biological Theory*
Now that we have checked that the coverage for got both articles and their references is satisfying, we can dig into some of the results. Let's start with the articles.

# Articles' results

# Wordclouds
Now that we have these tables, it might be of use to visualize those keywords and their importance.

## *Biology & Philosophy*.

## *Biological Theory*

**An important thing to note is that we don't have access to the keywords of the references provided by Scopus**

# Citation delay 
Here, we compute what we call citation delay. It is computed as the difference between the article publishing year and the mean year of the references the article cites. Here is the cumulative distribution function that shows the evolution of this citation delay as the journal gets older.

## What is the distribution of the citations? 
If this shift is interesting, we need to be careful. It could be only because as we go, we still cite old stuff, thus creating an artificial shift to the right not really problematif. Let's look at the distribution of citation delay. 


``` r
p4 <- all |> ggplot(aes(x = delay, group = decade, fill = from, color = from)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(from), cols = vars(decade)) 

ggplotly(p4) |> layout(legend = list(title = FALSE, orientation = "h",   # show entries horizontally
                     xanchor = "center",  # use center of legend as anchor
                     x = 0.5, y = 1.2))
```
