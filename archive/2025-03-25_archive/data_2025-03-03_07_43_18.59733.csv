Eaton;,Bioinformatics ,2013-12-03,2014-03-05,"Restriction-site associated genomic markers are a powerful tool for investigating evolutionary questions at the population level, but are limited in their utility at deeper phylogenetic scales where fewer orthologous loci are typically recovered across disparate taxa. While this limitation stems in part from mutations to restriction recognition sites that disrupt data generation, an alternative source of data loss comes from the failure to identify homology during bioinformatic analyses. Clustering methods that allow for lower similarity thresholds and the inclusion of indel variation will perform better at assembling RADseq loci at the phylogenetic scale.\n\nPyRAD is a pipeline to assemble de novo RADseq loci with the aim of optimizing coverage across phylogenetic data sets. It utilizes a wrapper around an alignment-clustering algorithm which allows for indel variation within and between samples, as well as for incomplete overlap among reads (e.g., paired-end). Here I compare PyRAD with the program Stacks in their performance analyzing a simulated RADseq data set that includes indel variation. Indels disrupt clustering of homologous loci in Stacks but not in PyRAD, such that the latter recovers more shared loci across disparate taxa. I show through re-analysis of an empirical RADseq data set that indels are a common feature of such data, even at shallow phylogenetic scales. PyRAD utilizes parallel processing as well as an optional hierarchical clustering method which allow it to rapidly assemble phylogenetic data sets with hundreds of sampled individuals.\n\nAvailabilitySoftware is written in Python and freely available at http://www.dereneaton.com/software/\n\nSupplementScripts to completely reproduce all simulated and empirical analyses are available in the Supplementary Materials.",Deren A.

Effects of form on static stability and control effectiveness.,Dennis Evangelista;Griselda Cardona;Eric Guenther-Gleason;Tony Huynh;Austin Kwong;Dylan Marks;Neil Ray;Adrian Tisbe;Kyle Tse;Mimi Kohl;,Biophysics ,2013-12-10,2014-01-15,"We report the effects of posture and morphology on the static aerodynamic stability and control effectiveness of physical models based on the feathered dinosaur, {dagger}Microraptor gui, from the Cretaceous of China. Postures had similar lift and drag coefficients and were broadly similar when simplified metrics of gliding were considered, but they exhibited different stability characteristics depending on the position of the legs and the presence of feathers on the legs and the tail. Both stability and the function of appendages in generating maneuvering forces and torques changed as the glide angle or angle of attack were changed. These are significant because they represent an aerial environment that may have shifted during the evolution of directed aerial descent and other aerial behaviors. Certain movements were particularly effective (symmetric movements of the wings and tail in pitch, asymmetric wing movements, some tail movements). Other appendages altered their function from creating yaws at high angle of attack to rolls at low angle of attack, or reversed their function entirely. While {dagger}M. gui lived after {dagger}Archaeopteryx and likely represents a side experiment with feathered morphology, the general patterns of stability and control effectiveness suggested from the manipulations of forelimb, hindlimb and tail morphology here may help understand the evolution of flight control aerodynamics in vertebrates. Though these results rest on a single specimen, as further fossils with different morphologies tested, the findings here could be applied in a phylogenetic context to reveal biomechanical constraints on extinct flyers arising from the need to maneuver.",Dennis  Evangelista,UC Berkeley

In particular, researchers interested in functional biology and adaptation have used these technologies to sequence mRNA transcriptomes of specific tissues, which in turn are often compared to other tissues, or other individuals with different phenotypes. While these techniques are extremely powerful, careful attention to data quality is required. In particular, because high-throughput sequencing is more error-prone than traditional Sanger sequencing, quality trimming of sequence reads should be an important step in all data processing pipelines. While several software packages for quality trimming exist, no general guidelines for the specifics of trimming have been developed. Here, using empirically derived sequence data, I provide general recommendations regarding the optimal strength of trimming, specifically in mRNA-Seq studies. Although very aggressive quality trimming is common, this study suggests that a more gentle trimming, specifically of those nucleotides whose PO_SCPLOWHREDC_SCPLOW score <2 or <5, is optimal for most studies across a wide variety of metrics.",Matthew D MacManes,University of New Hampshire

Atwal;,Biophysics ,2013-12-13,2014-03-10,"Motivated by data-rich experiments in transcriptional regulation and sensory neuro-science, we consider the following general problem in statistical inference. When exposed to a high-dimensional signal S, a system of interest computes a representation R of that signal which is then observed through a noisy measurement M. From a large number of signals and measurements, we wish to infer the \""filter\"" that maps S to R. However, the standard method for solving such problems, likelihood-based inference, requires perfect a priori knowledge of the \""noise function\"" mapping R to M. In practice such noise functions are usually known only approximately, if at all, and using an incorrect noise function will typically bias the inferred filter. Here we show that, in the large data limit, this need for a pre-characterized noise function can be circumvented by searching for filters that instead maximize the mutual information I[M; R] between observed measurements and predicted representations. Moreover, if the correct filter lies within the space of filters being explored, maximizing mutual information becomes equivalent to simultaneously maximizing every dependence measure that satisfies the Data Processing Inequality. It is important to note that maximizing mutual information will typically leave a small number of directions in parameter space unconstrained. We term these directions \""diffeomorphic modes\"" and present an equation that allows these modes to be derived systematically. The presence of diffeomorphic modes reflects a fundamental and nontrivial substructure within parameter space, one that is obscured by standard likelihood-based inference.",Justin B.

Korolev;Jose I Jimenez;Irene A. Chen;,Biophysics ,2014-02-24,2014-02-18,"Conjugation is the primary mechanism of horizontal gene transfer that spreads antibiotic resistance among bacteria. Although conjugation normally occurs in surface-associated growth (e.g., biofilms), it has been traditionally studied in well-mixed liquid cultures lacking spatial structure, which is known to affect many evolutionary and ecological processes. Here we visualize spatial patterns of gene transfer mediated by F plasmid conjugation in a colony of Escherichia coli growing on solid agar, and we develop a quantitative understanding by spatial extension of traditional mass-action models. We found that spatial structure suppresses conjugation in surface-associated growth because strong genetic drift leads to spatial isolation of donor and recipient cells, restricting conjugation to rare boundaries between donor and recipient strains. These results suggest that ecological strategies, such as enforcement of spatial structure and enhancement of genetic drift, could complement molecular strategies in slowing the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.",Irene A.

The model can lead to effective nonlocal interactions among nucleosomes suggested in previous theoretical studies, and epigenetic memory is robustly inheritable against stochastic cellular processes.\n\nPACS numbers: 82.39.Rt, 87.17.Aa, 87.16.Yc, 87.16.A",Jianhua  Xing,Virginia Tech

The biological interrogation of these cells continues to yield volumes of information on their pro-tumourigenic behaviour, but actionable generalised conclusions have been scarce. Further, new information suggesting a dependence of tumour composition and growth on the microenvironment has yet to be studied theoretically. To address this point, we created a hybrid, discrete/continuous computational cellular automaton model of a generalised stem-cell driven tissue with a simple microenvironment. Using the model we explored the phenotypic traits inherent to the tumour initiating cells and the effect of the microenvironment on tissue growth. We identify the regions in phenotype parameter space where TICs are able to cause a disruption in homeostasis, leading to tissue overgrowth and tumour maintenance. As our parameters and model are non-specific, they could apply to any tissue TIC and do not assume specific genetic mutations. Targeting these phenotypic traits could represent a generalizable therapeutic strategy across cancer types. Further, we find that the microenvironmental variable does not strongly effect the outcomes, suggesting a need for direct feedback from the microenvironment onto stem-cell behaviour in future modelling endeavours.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this paper, we present a mathematical/computational model of a tumour growing according to the canonical cancer stem-cell hypothesis with a simplified microenvironment. We explore the parameters of this model and find good agreement between our model and other theoretical models in terms of the intrinsic cellular parameters, which are difficult to study biologically. We find, however, disagreement between novel biological data and our model in terms of the microenvironmental changes. We conclude that future theoretical models of stem-cell driven tumours must include specific feedback from the microenvironment onto the individual cellular behavior. Further, we identify several cell intrinsic parameters which govern loss of homeostasis into a state of uncontrolled growth.",Jacob  Scott,H.

We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf1 mediates this homeostatic response in mammalian cells. We show here that Nrf1 is initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but is rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on p97/VCP. Normally, retrotranslocated Nrf1 is degraded by the proteasome and active species do not accumulate. However, in cells with compromised proteasomes, retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved N-terminal to Leu-104 to yield a fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER-membrane. Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon proteasome inhibition. Our data uncover an unexpected role for p97 in activation of a transcription factor by relocalizing it from the ER lumen to the cytosol.",Raymond J Deshaies,California Institute of Technology

CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. Here we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In mitotic cells, membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be \""restarted\"" in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown.",Stephen J Royle,University of Warwick

Local population dynamics is important for determining the strength of this rescue effect, but the mechanistic link between local demographic parameters and the rescue effect at the metapopulation level has received very little attention by modellers. We develop an analytical framework that allows us to describe the emergence of the rescue effect from interacting local stochastic dynamics. We show this framework to be applicable to a wide range of spatial scales, providing a powerful and convenient alternative to individual-based models for making predictions concerning the fate of metapopulations. We show that the rescue effect plays an important role in minimising the increase in local extinction probability associated with high demographic stochasticity, but its role is more limited in the case of high local environmental stochasticity of recruitment or survival. While most models postulate the rescue effect, our framework provides an explicit mechanistic link between local dynamics and the emergence of the rescue effect, and more generally the stability of the whole metapopulation.",Anders  Eriksson,University of Cambridge

Spatial structure can promote cooperation, but spatial expansions may also make it hard for mutualistic partners to stay together, since genetic drift at the expansion front creates regions of low genetic and species diversity. To explore the antagonism between mutualism and genetic drift, we grew cross-feeding strains of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae on agar surfaces as a model for mutualists undergoing spatial expansions. By supplying varying amounts of the exchanged nutrients, we tuned strength and symmetry of the mutualistic interaction. Strong mutualism suppresses genetic demixing during spatial expansions and thereby maintains diversity, but weak or asymmetric mutualism is overwhelmed by genetic drift even when mutualism is still beneficial, slowing growth and reducing diversity. Theoretical modeling using experimentally measured parameters predicts the size of demixed regions and how strong mutualism must be to survive a spatial expansion.",Melanie JI Mueller,Harvard University

Our understanding of these variants is limited by sample sizes of current studies and by measurements of mRNA rather than protein abundance. We developed a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in very large populations of the yeast Saccharomyes cerevisiae. The method measures single-cell protein abundance through the use of green-fluorescent-protein tags. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci cluster at hotspot locations that influence multiple proteins--in some cases, more than half of those examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains.",Leonid  Kruglyak,UCLA

This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \""one-off\"" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood.\n\nResultsHere, we identified CTLP in 918 cancer samples, from a dataset of more than 22,000 oncogenomic arrays covering 132 cancer types. Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate.\n\nConclusionsThrough a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \""chromothripsis\""-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \""chromthripsis\"" phenomenon.",Michael  Baudis,University of Zurich

Although the discussion has been ongoing in the fMRI community since the early days of fMRI data analyses, this subject has gained renewed attention in recent years due to the surging popularity of functional connectivity analyses, in particular graph theory-based network analyses. However, the impact of correcting (or not correcting) for global signals has not been systematically characterized in the context of network analyses. Thus, in this work, I examined the effect of global signal correction on an fMRI network analysis. In particular, voxel-based resting-state fMRI networks were constructed with and without global signal correction. The resulting functional connectivity networks were compared. Without global signal correction, the distributions of the correlation coefficients were positively biased. I also found that, without global signal correction, nodes along the interhemisphic fissure were highly connected whereas some nodes and subgraphs around white-matter tracts became disconnected from the rest of the network. These results from this study show differences between the networks with or without global signal correction.",Satoru  Hayasaka,Wake Forest School of Medicine

Granule cells (GCs) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) are presumed to sculpt activity that reaches the olfactory cortex via inhibition of mitral/tufted cells (MTs). GCs may potentially sparsen ensemble activity by facilitating lateral inhibition among MTs, and/or they may enforce temporally-precise activity locked to breathing. Yet, the selectivity and temporal structure of GC activity during wakefulness are unknown. We recorded GCs in the MOB of anesthetized and awake mice and reveal pronounced state-dependent features of odor coding and temporal patterning. Under anesthesia, GCs exhibit sparse activity and are strongly and synchronously coupled to the respiratory cycle. Upon waking, GCs desynchronize, broaden their odor responses, and typically fire without regard for the respiratory rhythm. Thus during wakefulness, GCs exhibit stronger odor responses with less temporal structure. Based on these observations, we propose that during wakefulness GCs likely predominantly shape MT odor responses through broadened lateral interactions rather than respiratory synchronization.",Stephen David Shea,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

However, Bayesian species delimitation methods typically require brute force integration over gene trees via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which introduces a large computation burden and precludes their application to genomic-scale data. Here we combine a recently introduced dynamic programming algorithm for estimating species trees that bypasses MCMC integration over gene trees with sophisticated methods for estimating marginal likelihoods, needed for Bayesian model selection, to provide a rigorous and computationally tractable technique for genome-wide species delimitation. We provide a critical yet simple correction that brings the likelihoods of different species trees, and more importantly their corresponding marginal likelihoods, to the same common denominator, which enables direct and accurate comparisons of competing species delimitation models using Bayes factors. We test this approach, which we call Bayes factor delimitation (*with genomic data; BFD*), using common species delimitation scenarios with computer simulations. Varying the numbers of loci and the number of samples suggest that the approach can distinguish the true model even with few loci and limited samples per species. Misspecification of the prior for population size{theta} has little impact on support for the true model. We apply the approach to West African forest geckos (Hemidactylus fasciatus complex) using genome-wide SNP data data.

Substrate addition to yeast expressing transporter fusions with yellow fluorescent protein and mCerulean triggered substrate-dependent donor quenching or resonance energy transfer. Fluorescence changes were nitrate/peptide-specific, respectively. Like CHL1, NiTrac1 had biphasic kinetics. Mutation of T101A eliminated high-affinity transport and blocked the fluorescence response to low nitrate. NiTrac was used for characterizing side chains considered important for substrate interaction, proton coupling, and regulation. We observed a striking correlation between transport activity and sensor output. Coexpression of NiTrac with known calcineurin-like proteins (CBL1, 9; CIPK23) and candidates identified in an interactome screen (CBL1, KT2, WNKinase 8) blocked NiTrac1 responses, demonstrating the suitability for in vivo analysis of activity and regulation.

This movement is powered by the parasite own actomyosin system and depends on the regulated polymerisation and depolymerisation of actin to generate the force for gliding and host cell penetration. Recent studies demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii can invade the host cell in the absence of several core components of the invasion machinery, such as the motor protein myosin A (MyoA), the microneme proteins MIC2 and AMA1 and actin, indicating the presence of alternative invasion mechanisms. Here the roles of MyoA, MLC1, GAP45 and Act1, core components of the gliding machinery, are re-dissected in detail. Although important roles of these components for gliding motility and host cell invasion are verified, mutant parasites remain invasive and do not show a block of gliding motility, suggesting that other mechanisms must be in place to enable the parasite to move and invade the host cell.

Furthermore, we externally tuned synthetic biofilms to build nanoscale amyloid biomaterials with different structure and composition through the controlled expression of their constituent subunits with artificial gene circuits. By using synthetic cell-cell communication, our engineered biofilms can also autonomously manufacture dynamic materials whose structure and composition change with time. In addition, we show that by combining subunit-level protein engineering, controlled genetic expression of self-assembling subunit proteins, and macroscale spatial gradients, synthetic biofilms can pattern protein biomaterials across multiple length scales. This work lays a foundation for synthesizing, patterning, and controlling composite materials with engineered biological systems. We envision that this approach can be expanded to other cellular and biomaterials contexts for the construction of self-organizing, environmentally responsive, and tunable multiscale composite materials with heterogeneous functionalities.",Timothy  Lu,Massachusetts Institute of Technology

However, BABA-induced plant resistance to insects is less well-studied, especially its underlying mechanism. In this research, we applied BABA to wheat seedlings and tested its effects on Sitobion avenae. When applied as a soil drench, BABA significantly reduced weight of S. avenae, whereas foliar spray and seed treatment had no such effects. BABA-mediated suppression of S. avenae growth is dose dependent and could last at least for 7 days. The aminobutyric acid concentration in phloem sap of BABA-treated plants accumulated to high levels and increased with BABA concentrations applied. Moreover, after 10 days of treatment, the aminobutyric acid content in BABA-treated plants was still higher than that in control treatment. S. avenae could not discriminate artificial diet containing BABA from standard diet, indicating that BABA itself is not a deterrent to this aphid. Also S. avenae did not show preference for control plants or BABA-treated plants. Consistent with choice test results, S. avenae had similar feeding activities on control and BABA-treated plants, suggesting that BABA did not induce antifeedants in wheat seedlings. In addition, aminobutyric acid concentration in S. avenae feeding on BABA-treated plants was significantly higher than those feeding on control palnts. S. avenae growth rate was reduced on artificial diet containing BABA, indicating direct toxic effects of BABA to this aphid. These results suggest that BABA application could enhance wheat plant resistance to S. avenae and the mechanism is possibly due to direct toxicity of high BABA contents in plant phloem.",He-He  Cao,Northwest A&F University

Identifying viruses with these properties in their natural hosts could dramatically improve disease forecasting and surveillance. Recently, we discovered two novel members of the viral family Arteriviridae: simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV)-krc1 and SHFV-krc2, infecting a single wild red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Nearly nothing is known about the biological properties of SHFVs in nature, although the SHFV type strain, SHFV-LVR, has caused devastating outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in captive macaques. Here we detected SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 in 40% and 47% of 60 wild red colobus tested, respectively. We found viral loads in excess of 106 - 107 RNA copies per milliliter of blood plasma for each of these viruses. SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 also showed high genetic diversity at both the inter- and intra-host levels. Analyses of synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide diversity across viral genomes revealed patterns suggestive of positive selection in SHFV open reading frames (ORF) 5 (SHFV-krc2 only) and 7 (SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2). Thus, these viruses share several important properties with some of the most rapidly evolving, emergent RNA viruses.",David H. O'Connor,University of Wisconsin - Madison

We have recently developed an in vitro  breadboard prototyping platform based on E. coli cell extract that allows biocircuits to operate in an environment considerably simpler than but functionally similar to in vivo. The simplicity of this system makes it a promising tool for rapid biocircuit design and testing, as well as for probing fundamental aspects of gene circuit operation normally masked by cellular complexity. In this work we characterize the cell-free breadboard using real-time and simultaneous measurements of transcriptional and translational activities of a small set of reporter genes and a transcriptional activation cascade. We determine the effects of promoter strength, gene concentration, and nucleoside triphosphate concentration on biocircuit properties, and we isolate the specific contributions of essential biomolecular resources--core RNA polymerase and ribosomes--to overall performance. Importantly, we show how limits on resources, particularly those involved in translation, are manifested as reduced expression in the presence of orthogonal genes that serve as additional loads on the system.",Dan  Siegal-Gaskins,California Institute of Technology

It is proposed that cell-free RNA replication in the primordial soup may have been driven by self-sustained oscillatory thermochemical reactions. To test this hypothesis a well-characterised hydrogen peroxide oscillator was chosen as the driver and complementary RNA strands with known association and melting kinetics were used as the substrate. An open flow system model for the self-consistent, coupled evolution of the temperature and concentrations in a simple autocatalytic scheme is solved numerically, and it is shown that thermochemical cycling drives replication of the RNA strands. For the (justifiably realistic) values of parameters chosen for the simulated example system, the mean amount of replicant produced at steady state is 6.56 times the input amount, given a constant supply of substrate species. The spontaneous onset of sustained thermochemical oscillations via slowly drifting parameters is demonstrated, and a scheme is given for prebiotic production of complementary RNA strands on rock surfaces.",Rowena  Ball,The Australian National University

This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes, ranging from evolutionary adaptation and speciation to the spread of genetic diseases and drug resistance. An interesting and important component of this variability is present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability, gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the fold change in gene expression. The model combines single-base pair resolution maps of transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding energies with a comprehensive thermodynamic model of gene regulation. The model was validated by predicting and then measuring the variability of lac operon regulation in a collection of natural isolates.

The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. We applied the model to GWAS of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, BMI, and Crohns disease. For each trait, we evaluated the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over a hundred tissues and cell lines. We show that the fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs that influence protein sequence ranges from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for LDL cholesterol); that repressed chromatin is significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits; and that cell type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites are enriched for SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume).

Previous studies suggested that the landscape-scale distribution of larval anurans is influenced by environmental gradients related to adult breeding site selection, such as pond canopy cover, but not water chemistry. However, the combined effects of spatial, pond morphology, and water chemistry variables on metacommunity structure of larval anurans have not been analyzed. We used a partial redundancy analysis with variation partitioning to analyze the relative influence of pond morphology (e.g., depth, area, and aquatic vegetation), water chemistry, and spatial variables on a tadpole metacommunity from southeastern Brazil. We predict that the metacommunity will be spatially structured at broad spatial scales, while environmental variables, mainly related to adult habitat selection, would play a larger role at fine spatial scales. We found that broad-scale spatial patterns of pond canopy cover and pond morphology strongly influenced metacommunity structure. Additionally, species composition was spatially autocorrelated at short distances. We suggest that the reproductive behavior of adult anurans is driving tadpole metacommunity dynamics, since pond morphology, but not water chemistry affects breeding site selection by adults.

To precisely define the role of specific hematopoietic cells in TPO dependent hematopoiesis, we generated mice that express the Mpl receptor normally on stem/progenitor cells but lack expression on megakaryocytes and platelets (MplPF4cre/PF4cre). MplPF4cre/PF4cre mice displayed profound megakaryocytosis and thrombocytosis with a remarkable expansion of megakaryocyte-committed and multipotential progenitor cells, the latter displaying biological responses and a gene expression signature indicative of chronic TPO over-stimulation as the underlying causative mechanism, despite a normal circulating TPO level. Thus, TPO signaling in megakaryocytes is dispensable for platelet production; its key role in control of platelet number is via generation and stimulation of the bipotential megakaryocyte precursors. Nevertheless, Mpl expression on megakaryocytes and platelets is essential to prevent megakaryocytosis and myeloproliferation by restricting the amount of TPO available to stimulate the production of megakaryocytes from the progenitor cell pool.\n\nSignificance statementBlood platelets, the small circulating cells that co-ordinate hemostasis, are produced by specialized bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes. The cytokine thrombopoietin (TPO) is a key regulator of platelet production acting via its specific cell receptor, Mpl. Via genetic modification of the Mpl allele in mice, we precisely define the bone marrow cells that express Mpl and, by genetically removing Mpl from megakaryocytes and platelets, we show TPO signaling via Mpl is not required in megakaryocytes for their expansion, maturation or platelet production. Rather, Mpl expression on megakaryocytes is essential for regulating TPO availability in the bone marrow microenvironment to prevent myeloproliferation, a model we suggest is important for human disease.",Ashley P Ng,The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research

However, manipulation may conflict with the fitness interests of the manipulated individuals. Manipulated individuals can then be favored to resist manipulation, possibly reducing or eliminating the manipulated behavior in the long run. I use a mathematical model to show that conflicts where manipulation and resistance coevolve can disappear as a result of the coevolutionary process. I find that while manipulated individuals are selected to resist, they can simultaneously be favored to express the manipulated behavior at higher efficiency (i.e., providing increasing fitness effects to recipients of the manipulated behavior). Efficiency can increase to a point at which selection for resistance disappears. This process yields an efficient social behavior that is induced by social partners, and over which the inducing and induced individuals are no longer in conflict. A necessary factor is costly inefficiency. I develop the model to address the evolution of advanced eusociality via maternal manipulation (AEMM). The model predicts AEMM to be particularly likely in taxa with ancestrally imperfect resistance to maternal manipulation. Costly inefficiency occurs if the cost of delayed dispersal is larger than the benefit of exploiting the maternal patch.

Applications of this theory range from cell dynamics to social evolution. However, many applications make it clear that inherent non-linearities of natural systems need to be taken into account.

An example is of social dilemmas, where group benefits could e.g. increase less than linear with the number of cooperators. Such multiplayer games can be introduced in all the fields where evolutionary game theory is already well established. However, the inclusion of non-linearities can help to advance the analysis of systems which are known to be complex, e.g. in the case of non-Mendelian inheritance.

These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory is required for motility, morphology of, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers en route to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1 and kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for SNX-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde-retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.",David J Stephens,University of Bristol

Two critical components of NMA methods are coarse-graining in the level of simplification used to represent protein structures and the choice of potential energy functional form. There is a trade-off between speed and accuracy in different choices. In one extreme one finds accurate but slow molecular-dynamics based methods with all-atom representations and detailed atom potentials. On the other extreme, fast elastic network model (ENM) methods with Conly representations and simplified potentials that based on geometry alone, thus oblivious to protein sequence. Here we present ENCoM, an Elastic Network Contact Model that employs a potential energy function that includes a pairwise atom-type non-bonded interaction term and thus makes it possible to consider the effect of the specific nature of amino-acids on dynamics within the context of NMA. ENCoM is as fast as existing ENM methods and outperforms such methods in the generation of conformational ensembles. Here we introduce a new application for NMA methods with the use of ENCoM in the prediction of the effect of mutations on protein stability. While existing methods are based on machine learning or enthalpic considerations, the use of ENCoM, based on vibrational normal modes, is based on entropic considerations. This represents a novel area of application for NMA methods and a novel approach for the prediction of the effect of mutations. We compare ENCoM to a large number of methods in terms of accuracy and self-consistency. We show that the accuracy of ENCoM is comparable to that of the best existing methods.

We used previously described GWAS signals (\""hits\"") to train a regularized logistic model in order to predict SNP causality on the basis of a large multivariate functional dataset. We show how this model can be used to derive Bayes factors for integrating functional and association data into a combined Bayesian analysis. Functional characteristics were obtained from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), from published expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and from other sources of genome-wide characteristics. We trained the model using all GWAS signals combined, and also using phenotype specific signals for autoimmune, brain-related, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. The non-phenotype specific and the autoimmune GWAS signals gave the most reliable results. We found SNPs with higher probabilities of causality from functional characteristics showed an enrichment of more significant p-values compared to all GWAS SNPs in three large GWAS studies of complex traits. We investigated the ability of our Bayesian method to improve the identification of true causal signals in a psoriasis GWAS dataset and found that combining functional data with association data improves the ability to prioritise novel hits. We used the predictions from the penalized logistic regression model to calculate Bayes factors relating to functional characteristics and supply these online alongside resources to integrate these data with association data.\n\nAuthor SummaryLarge-scale genetic studies have had success identifying genes that play a role in complex traits. Advanced statistical procedures suggest that there are still genetic variants to be discovered, but these variants are difficult to detect. Incorporating biological information that affect the amount of protein or other product produced can be used to prioritise the genetic variants in order to identify which are likely to be causal. The method proposed here uses such biological characteristics to predict which genetic variants are most likely to be causal for complex traits.",Jo  Knight,Centre for Addiction and Mental Health

Linking such population transformation constructs to genes which render them unable to transmit pathogens could eventually be used to stop the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.\n\nResultsGenerally, population transformation constructs with only a single transgenic drive mechanism have been envisioned. Using a theoretical modelling approach we describe the predicted properties of a construct combining autosomal Medea and underdominant population transformation systems. We show that when combined they can exhibit synergistic properties which in broad circumstances surpass those of the single systems.\n\nConclusionWith combined systems, intentional population transformation and its reversal can be achieved readily. Combined constructs also enhance the capacity to geographically restrict transgenic constructs to targeted populations. It is anticipated that these properties are likely to be of particular value in attracting regulatory approval and public acceptance of this novel technology.",Chaitanya  Gokhale,Massey University

A variety of algorithms have been developed to identify regions of open chromatin from raw sequence-tag data, which has motivated us to assess and compare their performance.\n\nIn this study, four published, publicly available peak calling algorithms used for DNase-seq data analysis (F-seq, Hotspot, MACS and ZINBA) are assessed at a range of signal thresholds on two published DNase-seq datasets for three cell types. The results were benchmarked against an independent dataset of regulatory regions derived from ENCODE in vivo transcription factor binding data for each particular cell type. The level of overlap between peak regions reported by each algorithm and this ENCODE-derived reference set was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms.\n\nOur study suggests that F-seq has a slightly higher sensitivity than the next best algorithms. Hotspot and the ChIP-seq oriented method, MACS, both perform competitively when used with their default parameters. However the generic peak finder ZINBA appears to be less sensitive than the other three.\n\nWe also assess accuracy of each algorithm over a range of signal thresholds. In particular, we show that the accuracy of F-Seq can be considerably improved by using a threshold setting that is different from the default value.",Hashem  Koohy,Babraham Institute

In budding yeast, starvation causes a drop in intracellular pH, but the functional role of this pH change is not well understood. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzyme inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between nutritional stress, the metabolism and the physical organization of a cell.",Simon  Alberti,Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics

Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computa- tional model inaccuracies and data uncertainties.

To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5{degrees}C and 32.5{degrees}C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes 33 hours at 17.5{degrees}C, and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5{degrees}C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D. melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly, develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D. virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration above 22.5{degrees}C and have drastically slowed development by 30{degrees}C. Despite ranging from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30{degrees}C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5{degrees}C, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across all of the species and temperatures examined here, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized timer controlling the progress of embryogenesis that has been tuned by natural selection in response to the thermal environment in which each species lives.\n\nAuthor SummaryTemperature profoundly impacts the rate of development of \""cold-blooded\"" animals, which proceeds far faster when it is warm. There is, however, no universal relationship. Closely related species can develop at markedly different speeds at the same temperature, likely resulting from environmental adaptation. This creates a major challenge when comparing development among species, as it is unclear whether they should be compared at the same temperature or under different conditions to maintain the same developmental rate. Facing this challenge while working with flies (Drosophila species), we found there was little data to inform this decision. So, using time-lapse imaging, precise temperature-control, and computational and manual video-analysis, we tracked the complex process of embryogenesis in 11 species at seven different temperatures. There was over a three-fold difference in developmental rate between the fastest species at its fastest temperature and the slowest species at its slowest temperature. However, our finding that the timing of events within development all scaled uniformly across species and temperatures astonished us. This is good news for developmental biologists, since we can induce species to develop nearly identically by growing them at different temperatures. But it also means flies must possess some unknown clock-like molecular mechanism driving embryogenesis forward.",Steven Gregory Kuntz,"University of California, Berkeley"

Heuristic properties can suggest preferred indices, but we lack objective ways to discriminate between indices with similar heuristics. Biodiversity indices can be evaluated by determining how well they reflect management objectives that a monitoring program aims to support. For example, the Convention on Biological Diversity requires reporting about extinction rates, so simple indices that reflect extinction risk would be valuable. Here we develop three biodiversity indices that are based on simple models of population viability that relate extinction risk to abundance. The first index is based on the geometric mean abundance of species. A second uses a more general power mean. A third integrates both the geometric mean abundance and trend. These indices require the same data as previous indices, but they also relate directly to extinction risk. Field data for butterflies and woodland plants, and experimental studies of protozoan communities show that the indices correlate with local extinction rates. Applying the index based on the geometric mean to global data on changes in avian abundance suggests that the average extinction probability of birds has increased approximately 1% from 1970 to 2009.",Michael A.

Social evolution theory has long recognized that all of these factors can lead to different selection pressures but has only recently attempted to synthesize how these factors interact. Using models for both discrete and continuous phenotypes, we show that analyzing these factors in a consistent framework reveals that they interact with one another in ways previously overlooked. Specifically, behavioral responses (reciprocity), genetic relatedness, and synergy interact in non-trivial ways that cannot be easily captured by simple summary indices of assortment. We demonstrate the importance of these interactions by showing how they have been neglected in previous synthetic models of social behavior both within and between species. These interactions also affect the level of behavioral responses that can evolve in the long run; proximate biological mechanisms are evolutionarily stable when they generate enough responsiveness relative to the level of responsiveness that exactly balances the ecological costs and benefits. Given the richness of social behavior across taxa, these interactions should be a boon for empirical research as they are likely crucial for describing the complex relationship linking ecology, demography, and social behavior.",Jeremy  Van Cleve,National Evolutionary Synthesis Center

Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and are maintained by strong selection acting on colour pattern.

We use restriction associated DNA sequencing to obtain several thousand genome wide sequence markers and use these to analyse patterns of population divergence across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two approaches for analysis of this type of data; alignment to a reference genome and de novo assembly, and find that alignment gives the best results for species both closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. erato, ~15% divergent) related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that the colour pattern controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions across the genome, but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to colour pattern differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously unmapped colour pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus. Finally, we identify within our sample a new cryptic population of H. timareta in Ecuador, which occurs at relatively low altitude and is mimetic with H. melpomene malleti.",Chri  Jiggins,Cambridge

The IIF protocol on HEp-2 cells has been the hallmark method to identify the presence of ANAs, due to its high sensitivity and the large range of antigens that can be detected. However, it suffers from numerous shortcomings, such as being subjective as well as time and labour intensive. Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems have been developed to address these problems, which automatically classify a HEp-2 cell image into one of its known patterns (eg. speckled, homogeneous). Most of the existing CAD systems use handpicked features to represent a HEp-2 cell image, which may only work in limited scenarios. We propose a novel automatic cell image classification method termed Cell Pyramid Matching (CPM), which is comprised of regional histograms of visual words coupled with the Multiple Kernel Learning framework.

We developed a ground truth dataset to further evaluate our calls by identifying recombination cross-overs in the pedigree and testing variants for consistency with the inferred phasing, and we show that our method significantly outperforms singleton and population variant calling in pedigrees.

As individual research labs, rather than centralized centers, begin to sequence the majority of new genomes, it is important to establish best practices for genome assembly. However, recent evaluations such as GAGE and the Assemblathon have concluded that there is no single best approach to genome assembly. Instead, it is preferable to generate multiple assemblies and validate them to determine which is most useful for the desired analysis; this is a labor-intensive process that is often impossible or unfeasible.\n\nResultsTo encourage best practices supported by the community, we present iMetAMOS, an automated ensemble assembly pipeline; iMetAMOS encapsulates the process of running, validating, and selecting a single assembly from multiple assemblies. iMetAMOS packages several leading open-source tools into a single binary that automates parameter selection and execution of multiple assemblers, scores the resulting assemblies based on multiple validation metrics, and annotates the assemblies for genes and contaminants. We demonstrate the utility of the ensemble process on 225 previously unassembled Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes as well as a Rhodobacter sphaeroides benchmark dataset. On these real data, iMetAMOS reliably produces validated assemblies and identifies potential contamination without user intervention. In addition, intelligent parameter selection produces assemblies of R. sphaeroides that exceed the quality of those from the GAGE-B evaluation, affecting the relative ranking of some assemblers.\n\nConclusionsEnsemble assembly with iMetAMOS provides users with multiple, validated assemblies for each genome. Although computationally limited to small or mid-sized genomes, this approach is the most effective and reproducible means for generating high-quality assemblies and enables users to select an assembly best tailored to their specific needs.",Sergey  Koren,National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center

The set of functional predictors we examined includes measures that have been demonstrated to correlate with the association status of SNPs in the GC and some whose utility in this regard is speculative: summaries of the UCSC Human Genome Browser ENCODE super-track data, dbSNP function class, sequence conservation summaries, proximity to genomic variants included in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) and known regulatory elements included in the Open Regulatory Annotation database (ORegAnno), PolyPhen-2 probabilities and RegulomeDB categories. Because we expected that only a fraction of the annotation variables would contribute to predicting association, we employed a penalized likelihood method to reduce the impact of non-informative predictors and evaluated the models ability to predict GC SNPs not used to construct the model. We show that the functional data alone are predictive of a SNPs presence in the GC.

Mark Evans;,Cell Biology ,2014-01-28,2014-04-22,"Herein we demonstrate how nanojunctions between lysosomes and sarcoplasmic reticulum (L-SR junctions) serve to couple lysosomal activation to regenerative, ryanodine receptor-mediated cellular Ca2+ waves. In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) it has been proposed that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) triggers increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a manner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the SR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been estimated to be < 400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy, which has restricted detailed investigations of the junctional coupling process. The present study utilizes standard and tomographic transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough ultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. We show that L-SR nanojunctions are prominent features within these cells and estimate that the junctional membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these measurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data. Simulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients demonstrate that the magnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By correlation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated Ca2+ transients within L-SR junctions, we estimate that \""trigger zones\"" with a 60-100 junctions are required to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the 130 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most importantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50 nm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. L-SR junctions are therefore a pre-requisite for efficient Ca2+ signal coupling and may contribute to cellular function in health and disease.",Nicola  Fameli,University of British Columbia

These are organized in four complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III) that act in a sequential fashion to deliver ubiquitylated cargoes into the internal luminal vesicles (ILVs) of the MVE. Drosophila genes encoding ESCRT-I, -II, -III components function in sorting signaling receptors, including Notch and the JAK/STAT signaling receptor Domeless. Loss of ESCRT-I, -II, -III in Drosophila epithelia causes altered signaling and cell polarity, suggesting that ESCRTs genes are tumor suppressors. However, the nature of the tumor suppressive function of ESCRTs, and whether tumor suppression is linked to receptor sorting is unclear. Unexpectedly, a null mutant in Hrs, encoding one of components of the ESCRT-0 complex, which acts upstream of ESCRT-I, -II, -III in MVE sorting is dispensable for tumor suppression. Here, we report that two Drosophila epithelia lacking activity of Stam, the other known components of the ESCRT-0 complex, or of both Hrs and Stam fail to degrade signaling receptors. However, mutant tissue surprisingly maintains normal apico-basal polarity and proliferation control and does not display ectopic Notch signaling activation, unlike cells that lack ESCRT-I, -II, -III activity.

However, empirical studies are equally clear that not all plants employ this strategy of over-proliferation of roots. Here, our goal was to develop and test an alternative non-game theoretic model that can be used to develop alternative hypotheses for plants that do not appear to play games.\nC_LIO_LIThe model is similar to previous models, but does not use a game theoretic optimization criterion. Instead, plants use only nutrient availability to select a root allocation strategy, ignoring neighbours. To test the model we compare root allocation and seed yield of plants grown either alone or with neighbours.\nC_LIO_LIThe model predicted plants that do not sense neighbours (or ignore neighbours) should allocate roots relative to resource availability following an ideal free distribution. This means that if a soil volume of quality R contains x roots, then a soil volume of quality R/n will contain x/n roots. The experimental data were consistent with this prediction. That is, plants grown with 1.2g of slow release fertilizer resources produced 0.043 g of roots, while plants grown with neighbours, or plants grown with half as much fertilizer produced half as much root mass (0.026g, and 0.24g respectively).

Models suggest over-proliferation is an unbeatable evolutionary stable strategy, yet plants that do not play the game apparently coexist with plants that do.

We used sequential filtration size fractionation to measure, for the first time, the particle size distribution (PSD) of macrobial eDNA, specifically Common Carp (hereafter referred to as Carp) eDNA. We compared it to the PSDs of total eDNA (from all organisms) and suspended particle matter (SPM). We quantified Carp mitochondrial eDNA using a custom qPCR assay, total eDNA with fluorometry, and SPM with gravimetric analysis.\nC_LIO_LIIn a lake and a pond, we found Carp eDNA in particles from >180 to <0.2 m, but it was most abundant from 1-10 m. Total eDNA was most abundant below 0.2 m and SPM was most abundant above 100 m. SPM was [&le;]0.1% total eDNA, and total eDNA was [&le;]0.0004% Carp eDNA. 0.2 m filtration maximized Carp eDNA capture (85%{+/-}6%) while minimizing total (i.e., non-target) eDNA capture (48%{+/-}3%), but filter clogging limited this pore size to a volume <250 mL. To mitigate this limitation we estimated a continuous PSD model for Carp eDNA and derived an equation for calculating isoclines of pore size and water volume that yield equivalent amounts of Carp eDNA.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that aqueous macrobial eDNA predominantly exists inside mitochondria or cells, and that settling plays an important role in its fate. For optimal eDNA capture, we recommend 0.2 m filtration or a combination of larger pore size and water volume that exceeds the 0.2 m isocline. In situ filtration of large volumes could maximize detection probability when surveying large habitats for rare organisms. Our method for eDNA particle size analysis enables future research to compare the PSDs of eDNA from other organisms and environments, and to easily apply them for ecological monitoring.\nC_LI",Cameron R.

This is a puzzle because paying a cost to benefit another in one-shot interactions gives no direct or indirect benefits to the cooperator. This paper explores the logic of two competing evolutionary hypotheses to explain this behavior. The \""norm psychology\"" hypothesis holds that a player's choice of strategy reflects socially-learned cultural norms. Its premise is that over the course of human evolutionary history, cultural norms varied considerably across human societies and through a process of gene-culture co-evolution, humans evolved mechanisms to learn and adopt the norms that are successful in their particular society. The \""mismatch\"" hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically in our hunter-gatherer past where one-shot anonymous interactions were rare and these preferences are misapplied in modern laboratory settings. I compare these hypotheses by adopting a well-known model of the mismatch hypothesis and show that selection for one-shot cooperation in the model is an artifact of agents being constrained to only two strategies: Tit-for-Tat and Always Defect. Allowing for repentant and forgiving strategies reverses selection away from one-shot cooperation under all environmental parameters. Direct reciprocity does not necessarily lead to cooperation, but instead generates many different normative equilibria depending on a groups idiosyncratic evolutionary history. Therefore, an agent whose behavior is evoked solely from non-cultural environmental cues will be disadvantaged relative to an agent who learns the locally successful norms. Cooperation in one-shot laboratory experiments is thus more easily explained as the result of a psychology evolved for learning social norms than as a genetic mismatch.",Matthew  Zefferman,"National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis, University of Tennessee"

Identifying SNPs under natural selection and underpinning species adaptation relies on disentangling the respective contribution of random processes (mutation, drift, migration) from that of selection on nucleotide variability. Most theory and statistical tests have been developed using the Kingmans coalescent theory based on the Wright-Fisher population model. However, these theoretical models rely on biological and life-history assumptions which may be violated in many prokaryote, fungal, animal or plant species. Recent theoretical developments of the so called multiple merger coalescent models are reviewed here ({Lambda}-coalescent, beta-coalescent, Bolthausen-Snitzman, {Xi}-coalescent). We explicit how these new models take into account various pervasive ecological and biological characteristics, life history traits or life cycles which were not accounted in previous theories such as 1) the skew in offspring production typical of marine species, 2) fast adapting microparasites (virus, bacteria and fungi) exhibiting large variation in population sizes during epidemics, 3) the peculiar life cycles of fungi and bacteria alternating sexual and asexual cycles, and 4) the high rates of extinction-recolonization in spatially structured populations.

A number of theories predict the kinds of human learning strategies, as well as the population dynamics that result from their action. There is little work, however, that quantitatively examines the evidence for these strategies and resulting cultural evolution within human populations. One of the obstacles is the lack of individual-level data with which to link transmission events to larger cultural dynamics. Here, we address this problem with a rich quantitative database from the East Asian board game known as Go. We draw from a large archive of Go games spanning the last six decades of professional play, and find evidence that the evolutionary dynamics of particular cultural variants are driven by a mix of individual and social learning processes. Particular players vary dramatically in their sensitivity to population knowledge, which also varies by age and nationality. The dynamic patterns of opening Go moves are consistent with an ancient, ongoing arms race within the game itself.",Bret A Beheim,University of New Mexico

The synthesis of milk requires, in part, the mobilization of bodily reserves to nourish developing young. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to predict how mothers will differentially invest in sons and daughters, however few studies have addressed sex-biased milk synthesis. Here we leverage the dairy cow model to investigate such phenomena. Using 2.39 million lactation records from 1.49 million dairy cows, we demonstrate that the sex of the fetus influences the capacity of the mammary gland to synthesize milk during lactation. Cows favor daughters, producing significantly more milk for daughters than for sons across lactation. Using a sub-sample of this dataset (N = 113,750 subjects) we further demonstrate that the effects of fetal sex interact dynamically across parities, whereby the sex of the fetus being gestated can enhance or diminish the production of milk during an established lactation. Moreover the sex of the fetus gestated on the first parity has persistent consequences for milk synthesis on the subsequent parity. Specifically, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increases milk production by [~]445 kg over the first two lactations. Our results identify a dramatic and sustained programming of mammary function by offspring in utero. Nutritional and endocrine conditions in utero are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have received little attention to date.",Katie  Hinde,Harvard University

The epigenome is of interest as a possible mediator of environmental effects during development, encoding a cellular memory reflected by altered function of progeny cells. Advanced maternal age (AMA) is associated with an increased risk of having a child with ASD for reasons that are not understood. To explore whether AMA involves covert aneuploidy or epigenetic dysregulation leading to ASD in the offspring, we tested an homogeneous ectodermal cell type from 47 individuals with ASD compared with 48 typically developing (TD) controls born to mothers of [&ge;]35 years, using a quantitative genome-wide DNA methylation assay. We show that DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in ectodermal cells in these individuals, having accounted for confounding effects due to subject age, sex and ancestral haplotype. We did not find mosaic aneuploidy or copy number variability to occur at differentially-methylated regions in these subjects. Of note, the loci with distinctive DNA methylation were found at genes expressed in the brain and encoding protein products significantly enriched for interactions with those produced by known ASD-causing genes, representing a perturbation by epigenomic dysregulation of the same networks compromised by DNA mutational mechanisms. The results indicate the presence of a mosaic subpopulation of epigenetically-dysregulated, ectodermally-derived cells in subjects with ASD. The epigenetic dysregulation observed in these ASD subjects born to older mothers may be associated with aging parental gametes, environmental influences during embryogenesis or could be the consequence of mutations of the chromatin regulatory genes increasingly implicated in ASD. The results indicate that epigenetic dysregulatory mechanisms may complement and interact with DNA mutations in the pathogenesis of the disorder.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYOlder mothers have a higher than expected risk of having a child with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The reason for this increased risk is unknown. The eggs of older mothers are more prone to abnormalities of chromosome numbers, suggesting this as one possible mechanism of the increased ASD risk. Age is also associated with a loss of control of epigenetic regulatory patterns that govern gene expression, indicating a second potential mechanism. To test both possibilities, we sampled cells from the same developmental origin as the brain, and performed genome-wide tests looking for unusual chromosome numbers and DNA methylation patterns. The studies were performed on individuals with ASD and typically developing controls, all born to mothers at least 35 years of age at the time of birth. We found the cells from individuals with ASD to have changes in DNA methylation at a number of loci, especially near genes encoding proteins known to interact with those already implicated in ASD. We conclude that epigenetic dysregulation occurring in gametes or early embryonic life may be one of the contributors to the development of ASD.",John  Greally,Albert Einstein College of Medicine

We infer a time-labelled phylogeny using BEAST, then infer a transmission network via a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain. We find that under a realistic model of within-host evolution, reconstructions of simulated outbreaks contain substantial uncertainty even when genomic data reflect a high substitution rate. Reconstruction of a real-world tuberculosis outbreak displayed similar uncertainty, although the correct source case and several clusters of epidemiologically linked cases were identified.

In contrast, statin based drugs, which form the principle pharmaceutical agents for decreasing the activity of this pathway, target a single enzyme. Here, we build an ordinary differential equation model of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in order to investigate how the two regulatory strategies impact upon the behaviour of the pathway. We employ a modest set of assumptions: that the pathway operates away from saturation, that each metabolite is involved in multiple cellular interactions and that mRNA levels reflect enzyme concentrations. Using data taken from primary bone marrow derived macrophage cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus infection or treated with IFN{gamma}, we show that, under these assumptions, coordinate down regulation of enzyme activity imparts a graduated reduction in flux along the pathway. In contrast, modelling a statin-like treatment that achieves the same degree of down-regulation in cholesterol production, we show that this delivers a step change in flux along the pathway. The graduated reduction mediated by physiological coordinate regulation of multiple enzymes supports a mechanism that allows a greater level of specificity, altering cholesterol levels with less impact upon interactions branching from the pathway, than pharmacological step reductions. We argue that coordinate regulation is likely to show a long-term evolutionary advantage over single enzyme regulation. Finally, the results from our models have implications for future pharmaceutical therapies intended to target cholesterol production with greater specificity and fewer off target effects, suggesting that this can be achieved by mimicking the coordinated down-regulation observed in immunological responses.",Steven  Watterson,University of Ulster

Even though some of the essential phenomena that characterize crypt structure and dynamics have been effectively described in the past, the relation between the differentiation process and the overall crypt homeostasis is still partially understood. We here investigate this relation and other important biological phenomena by introducing a novel multiscale model that combines a morphological description of the crypt with a gene regulation model: the emergent dynamical behavior of the underlying gene regulatory network drives cell growth and differentiation processes, linking the two distinct spatio-temporal levels. The model relies on a few a priori assumptions, yet accounting for several key processes related to crypt functioning, such as: dynamic gene activation patterns, stochastic differentiation, signaling pathways ruling cell adhesion properties, cell displacement, cell growth, mitosis, apoptosis and the presence of biological noise.\n\nWe show that this modeling approach captures the major dynamical phenomena that characterize the regular physiology of crypts, such as cell sorting, coordinate migration, dynamic turnover, stem cell niche maintenance and clonal expansion. All in all, the model suggests that the process of stochastic differentiation might be sufficient to drive the crypt to homeostasis, under certain crypt configurations. Besides, our approach allows to make precise quantitative inferences that, when possible, were matched to the current biological knowledge and it permits to investigate the role of gene-level perturbations, with reference to cancer development. We also remark the theoretical framework is general and may applied to different tissues, organs or organisms.",Alex  Graudenzi,"Dept. of Informatics, Systems and Communication"

We further demonstrated that a set of protein-coding mRNAs, potentially targeted by the 9 miRNAs were down-regulated in the hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-34b, miR-340, miR-148a could down-regulate the reporter gene expression by interacting with the Met 3' UTR.

The Bantu languages subdivide in several major branches, with languages belonging to the Eastern and Western Bantu branches spreading over large parts of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa. There is still debate whether this linguistic divide is correlated with a genetic distinction between Eastern and Western Bantu speakers. During their expansion, Bantu speakers would have come into contact with diverse local populations, such as the Khoisan hunter-gatherers and pastoralists of southern Africa, with whom they may have intermarried. In this study, we analyze complete mtDNA genome sequences from over 900 Bantu-speaking individuals from Angola, Zambia, Namibia, and Botswana to investigate the demographic processes at play during the last stages of the Bantu expansion. Our results show that most of these Bantu-speaking populations are genetically very homogenous, with no genetic division between speakers of Eastern and Western Bantu languages. Most of the mtDNA diversity in our dataset is due to different degrees of admixture with autochthonous populations.

Unfortunately, existing evolutionary models do not realistically represent the site-heterogeneous selection that governs actual sequence change. Attempts to remedy this problem have involved augmenting these models with a burgeoning number of free parameters. Here I demonstrate an alternative: experimental determination of a parameter-free evolutionary model via mutagenesis, functional selection, and deep sequencing. Using this strategy, I create an evolutionary model for influenza nucleoprotein that describes the gene phylogeny far better than existing models with dozens or even hundreds of free parameters. Emerging high-throughput experimental strategies such as the one employed here provide fundamentally new information that has the potential to transform the sensitivity of phylogenetic and genetic analyses.",Jesse D Bloom,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center

Existing methods to infer transmission dynamics from sequence data rely on well-characterised infectious periods, epidemiological and clinical meta-data which may not always be available, and typically require computationally intensive analysis focussing on the branch lengths in phylogenetic trees. We sought to determine whether the topological structures of phylogenetic trees contain signatures of the overall transmission patterns underyling an outbreak. Here we use simulated outbreaks to train and then test computational classifiers. We test the method on data from two real-world outbreaks. We find that different transmission patterns result in quantitatively different phylogenetic tree shapes. We describe five topological features that summarize a phylogenys structure and find that computational classifiers based on these are capable of predicting an outbreaks transmission dynamics. The method is robust to variations in the transmission parameters and network types, and recapitulates known epidemiology of previously characterized real-world outbreaks. We conclude that there are simple structural properties of phylogenetic trees which, when combined, can distinguish communicable disease outbreaks with a super-spreader, homogeneous transmission, and chains of transmission. This is possible using genome data alone, and can be done during an outbreak. We discuss the implications for management of outbreaks.",Caroline  Colijn,Imperial College London

Molecular studies identified the disruption of the DISC1 (disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) gene by chromosome translocation at chromosome 1q42. Our previous studies, however, revealed that the translocation also disrupted another gene, Boymaw (also termed DISC1FP1), on chromosome 11. After translocation, two fusion genes (the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) and the Boymaw-DISC1 (BD13)) are generated between the DISC1 and Boymaw genes. In the present study, we report that expression of the DB7 fusion gene inhibits both intracellular NADH oxidoreductase activities and protein translation. We generated humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice with gene targeting to examine the in vivo functions of the fusion genes. Consistent with the in vitro studies on the DB7 fusion gene, protein translation activity is decreased in the hippocampus and in cultured primary neurons from the brains of the humanized mice. Expression of Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 proteins are also reduced. The humanized mice display prolonged and increased responses to the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, on various mouse genetic backgrounds. Abnormal information processing of acoustic startle and depressive-like behaviors are also observed. In addition, the humanized mice display abnormal erythropoiesis, which was reported to associate with depression in humans.

Armitage;Alexander George Fletcher;,Microbiology ,2014-01-21,2014-08-06,"Most free-swimming bacteria move in approximately straight lines, interspersed with random reorientation phases. A key open question concerns varying mechanisms by which reorientation occurs. We combine mathematical modelling with analysis of a large tracking dataset to study the poorly-understood reorientation mechanism in the monoflagellate species Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The flagellum on this species rotates counterclockwise to propel the bacterium, periodically ceasing rotation to enable reorientation. When rotation restarts the cell body usually points in a new direction. It has been assumed that the new direction is simply the result of Brownian rotation. We consider three variants of a self-propelled particle model of bacterial motility. The first considers rotational diffusion only, corresponding to a non-chemotactic mutant strain. A further two models also include stochastic reorientations, describing  run-and-tumble motility. We derive expressions for key summary statistics and simulate each model using a stochastic computational algorithm. We also discuss the effect of cell geometry on rotational diffusion. Working with a previously published tracking dataset, we compare predictions of the models with data on individual stopping events in R. sphaeroides. This provides strong evidence that this species undergoes some form of active reorientation rather than simple reorientation by Brownian rotation.",Alexander George Fletcher,University of Oxford

Despite the large amount of knowledge that we have accumulated to date about the regulation and control of self-renewal, efficient directed differentiation into specific tissues remains elusive. In this work, we have analyzed in a systematic manner the interaction between the dynamics of loss of pluripotency and Activin/Nodal, BMP4 and Wnt signalling in fate assignment during the early stages of differentiation of mouse ES cells in culture. During the initial period of differentiation cells exit from pluripotency and enter an Epi-like state. Following this transient stage, and under the influence of Activin/Nodal and BMP signalling, cells face a fate choice between differentiating into neuroectoderm and contributing to Primitive Streak fates. We find that Wnt signalling does not suppress neural development as previously thought and that it aids both fates in a context dependent manner. Our results suggest that as cells exit pluripotency they are endowed with a primary neuroectodermal fate and that the potency to become endomesodermal rises with time. We suggest that this situation translates into a \""race for fates\"" at the level of single cells in which the neuroectodermal fate has an advantage.",Alfonso  Martinez Arias,Department of Genetics.

There has been an increased interest in unraveling the community structure of biological systems as it may provide important insights into a systems functional components and the impact of local structures on dynamics at a global scale. Choosing an appropriate community detection algorithm to identify the community structure in an empirical network can be difficult, however, as the many algorithms available are based on a variety of cost functions and are difficult to validate. Even when community structure is identified in an empirical system, disentangling the effect of community structure from other network properties such as clustering coefficient and assortativity can be a challenge.\n\nResultsHere, we develop a generative model to produce undirected, simple, connected graphs with a specified degrees and pattern of communities, while maintaining a graph structure that is as random as possible. Additionally, we demonstrate two important applications of our model: (a) to generate networks that can be used to benchmark existing and new algorithms for detecting communities in biological networks; and (b) to generate null models to serve as random controls when investigating the impact of complex network features beyond the byproduct of degree and modularity in empirical biological networks.\n\nConclusionOur model allows for the systematic study of the presence of community structure and its impact on network function and dynamics.

Population genetic studies, however, often ignore BGS effects when investigating demographic events or the presence of other types of selection. To obtain a more realistic evolutionary expectation that incorporates the unavoidable consequences of deleterious mutations, we generated high-resolution landscapes of variation across the Drosophila melanogaster genome under a BGS scenario independent of polymorphism data. We find that BGS plays a significant role in shaping levels of variation across the entire genome, including long introns and intergenic regions distant from annotated genes. We also find that a very large percentage of the observed variation in diversity across autosomes can be explained by BGS alone, up to 70% across individual chromosome arms, thus indicating that BGS predictions can be used as baseline to infer additional types of selection and demographic events. This approach allows detecting several outlier regions with signal of recent adaptive events and selective sweeps. The use of a BGS baseline, however, is particularly appropriate to investigate the presence of balancing selection and our study exposes numerous genomic regions with the predicted signature of higher polymorphism than expected when a BGS context is taken into account. Importantly, we show that these conclusions are robust to the mutation and selection parameters of the BGS model. Finally, analyses of protein evolution together with previous comparisons of genetic maps between Drosophila species, suggest temporally variable recombination landscapes and thus, local BGS effects that may differ between extant and past phases. Because genome-wide BGS and temporal changes in linkage effects can skew approaches to estimate demographic and selective events, future analyses should incorporate BGS predictions and capture local recombination variation across genomes and along lineages.",Josep M Comeron,University of Iowa

Despite these differences, sequencing of 105 evolved clones showed no significant effect of initial genotype on future sequence-level evolution. Instead, reconstruction experiments revealed a consistent pattern of diminishing returns epistasis. Our results suggest that many beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled: they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. Sequence-level adaptation is thus highly stochastic. Nevertheless, fitness evolution is strikingly predictable because differences in adaptability are determined only by global fitness-mediated epistasis, not by the identity of individual mutations.",Michael M Desai,Harvard University

Similar co-enrichment observed in yeast so far has been treated as artifactual, and has not been fully characterized. Here we reanalyze ChIP data from both array-based and sequencing-based experiments to show that in the yeast S. cerevisiae, the collective enrichment phenomenon is strongly associated with proximity to noncoding RNA genes and with nucleosome depletion. DNA sequence motifs that confer binding affinity for the proteins are largely absent from these hotspots, suggesting that protein-protein interactions play a prominent role. The hotspots are condition-specific, suggesting that they reflect a chromatin state or protein state, and are not a static feature of underlying sequence. Additionally, only a subset of all assayed factors is associated with these loci, suggesting that the co-enrichment cannot be simply explained by a chromatin state that is universally more prone to immunoprecipitation. Together our results suggest that the co-enrichment patterns observed in yeast represent transcription factor co-occupancy. More generally, they make clear that great caution must be used when interpreting ChIP enrichment profiles for individual factors in isolation, as they will include factor-specific as well as collective contributions.",Harmen J.

T-cell receptor diversity results from an initial random DNA editing process, called VDJ recombination, followed by functional selection of cells according to the interaction of their surface receptors with self and foreign antigenic peptides. To quantify the effect of selection on the highly variable elements of the receptor, we apply a probabilistic maximum likelihood approach to the analysis of high-throughput sequence data from the {beta}-chain of human T-cell receptors. We quantify selection factors for V and J gene choice, and for the length and amino-acid composition of the variable region. Our approach is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from biases inherent in the recombination process. Inferred selection factors differ little between donors, or between naive and memory repertoires. The number of sequences shared between donors is well-predicted by the model, indicating a purely stochastic origin of such \""public\"" sequences.

We created a pool of > 1000 in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with poly-A and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length and we show IVT is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented.

These systems are often prone to abrupt and unexpected instabilities and state shifts that emerge as a discontinuous response to gradual changes in environmental drivers. Predicting such behaviours is crucial to the prevention of or preparation for unwanted regime shifts. Recent research in ecology has investigated early warning signs that anticipate the divergence of univariate ecosystem dynamics from a stable attractor. To date, leading indicators of instability in systems with multiple interacting components have remained poorly investigated. This is a major limitation in the understanding of the dynamics of complex social-ecological networks. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to demonstrate that rising variance - measured, for example, by the maximum element of the covariance matrix of the network - is an effective leading indicator of network instability. We show that its reliability and robustness depend more on the sign of the interactions within the network than the network structure or noise intensity. Mutualistic, scale free and small world networks are less stable than their antagonistic or random counterparts but their instability is more reliably predicted by this leading indicator.

Despite being empirically challenging to estimate, there are enough published estimates of G and {beta} to allow for synthesis of general patterns across species. We use published estimates to test the hypotheses that there are systematic differences in the rate of evolution among trait types, and that these differences are in part due to genetic architecture. We find evidence some evidence that sexually selected traits exhibit faster rates of evolution compared to life-history or morphological traits. This difference does not appear to be related to stronger selection on sexually selected traits. Using numerous proposed approaches to quantifying the shape, size and structure of G we examine how these parameters relate to one another, and how they vary among taxonomic and trait groupings. Despite considerable variation, they do not explain the observed differences in evolutionary rates.",Ian  Dworkin,Michigan State University

We used deep mutational scanning to examine the extent to which a high inherent mutational tolerance contributes to this antigenic evolvability. We created mutant viruses that incorporate most of the {approx} 104 amino-acid mutations to hemagglutinin from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza. After passaging these viruses in tissue culture to select for functional variants, we used deep sequencing to quantify mutation frequencies before and after selection. These data enable us to infer the preference for each amino acid at each site in hemagglutinin. These inferences are consistent with existing knowledge about the proteins structure and function, and can be used to create a model that describes hemagglutinins evolution far better than existing phylogenetic models. We show that hemagglutinin has a high inherent tolerance for mutations at antigenic sites, suggesting that this is one factor contributing to influenzas antigenic evolution.",Jesse D Bloom,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center

Recent resequencing projects report that stop-gains and frameshifts are collectively prevalent in humans and could be responsible for some of the inter-individual variability in innate immune response. Current computational approaches evaluating loss-of-function in genes carrying these variants rely on gene-level characteristics such as evolutionary conservation and functional redundancy across the genome. However, innate immunity genes represent a particular case because they are more likely to be under positive selection and duplicated. To create a ranking of severity that would be applicable to the innate immunity genes we first evaluated 17764 stop-gain and 13915 frameshift variants from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project and 1000 Genomes Project. Sequence-based features such as loss of functional domains, isoform-specific truncation and non-sense mediated decay were found to correlate with variant allele frequency and validated with gene expression data. We integrated these features in a Bayesian classification scheme and benchmarked its use in predicting pathogenic variants against OMIM disease stop-gains and frameshifts. The classification scheme was applied in the assessment of 335 stop-gains and 236 frameshifts affecting 227 interferon-stimulated genes.

Mahadevan;,Biophysics ,2014-07-03,2014-07-23,"Sperm cooperation has evolved in a variety of taxa and is often considered a response to sperm competition, yet the benefit of this form of collective movement remains unclear. Here we use fine-scale imaging and a minimal mathematical model to study sperm aggregation in the rodent genus Peromyscus. We demonstrate that as the number of sperm cells in an aggregate increase, the group moves with more persistent linearity but without increasing speed; this benefit, however, is offset in larger aggregates as the geometry of the group forces sperm to swim against one another. The result is a non-monotonic relationship between aggregate size and average velocity with both a theoretically predicted and empirically observed optimum of 6-7 sperm/aggregate. To understand the role of sexual selection in driving these sperm group dynamics, we compared two sister-species with divergent mating systems and find that sperm of P. maniculatus (highly promiscuous), which have evolved under intense competition, form optimal-sized aggregates more often than sperm of P. polionotus (strictly monogamous), which lack competition. Our combined mathematical and experimental study of coordinated sperm movement reveals the importance of geometry, motion and group size on sperm velocity and suggests how these physical variables interact with evolutionary selective pressures to regulate cooperation in competitive environments.",Heidi S.

One of the genes, DJ- 1/PARK7, linked with the onset of Parkinson's disease, belongs to a novel glyoxalase family and influences mitochondrial activity. It has been assumed that glyoxalases fulfill this task by detoxifying aggressive aldehyde by-products of metabolism. Here we show that supplying either D-lactate or glycolate, products of DJ-1, rescues the requirement for the enzyme in maintenance of mitochondrial potential. We further show that glycolic acid and D-lactic acid can elevate lowered mitochondrial membrane potential caused by silencing PINK-1, another Parkinson's related gene, as well as by paraquat, an environmental toxin known to be linked with Parkinson's disease. We propose that DJ-1 and consequently its products are components of a novel pathway that stabilizes mitochondria during cellular stress. We go on to show that survival of cultured mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, defective in Parkinson's disease, is enhanced by glycolate and D-lactate. Because glycolic and D-lactic acids occur naturally, they are therefore a potential therapeutic route for treatment or prevention of Parkinson's disease.",Teymuras V.

Population genetic theory predicts that soft sweeps should be likely if the product of the population size and the mutation rate towards the adaptive allele is sufficiently large, such that multiple adaptive mutations can establish before one has reached fixation; however, it remains unclear how demographic processes affect the probability of observing soft sweeps. Here we extend the theory of soft selective sweeps to realistic demographic scenarios that allow for changes in population size over time. We first show that population bottlenecks can lead to the removal of all but one adaptive lineage from an initially soft selective sweep. The parameter regime under which such 'hardening' of soft selective sweeps is likely is determined by a simple heuristic condition. We further develop a generalized analytical framework, based on an extension of the coalescent process, for calculating the probability of soft sweeps under arbitrary demographic scenarios. Two important limits emerge within this analytical framework: In the limit where population size fluctuations are fast compared to the duration of the sweep, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by the harmonic mean of the variance effective population size estimated over the duration of the sweep; in the opposing slow fluctuation limit, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by the instantaneous variance effective population size at the onset of the sweep. We show that as a consequence of this finding the probability of observing soft sweeps becomes a function of the strength of selection. Specifically, in species with sharply fluctuating population size, strong selection is more likely to produce soft sweeps than weak selection. Our results highlight the importance of accurate demographic estimates over short evolutionary timescales for understanding the population genetics of adaptation from de novo mutation.",Benjamin A Wilson,Stanford University

Traditionally, the details of the site-specific selection that governs sequence evolution are not known a priori, making it challenging to create evolutionary models that adequately capture the heterogeneity of selection at different sites. However, recent advances in high-throughput experiments have made it possible to quantify the effects of all single mutations on gene function. I have previously shown that such high-throughput experiments can be combined with knowledge of underlying mutation rates to create a parameter-free evolutionary model that describes the phylogeny of influenza nucleoprotein far better than commonly used existing models. Here I extend this work by showing that published experimental data on TEM-1 beta-lactamase (Firnberg et al, 2014) can be combined with a few mutation rate parameters to create an evolutionary model that describes beta-lactamase phylogenies much than most common existing models. This experimentally informed evolutionary model is superior even for homologs that are substantially diverged (about 35% divergence at the protein level) from the TEM-1 parent that was the subject of the experimental study. These results suggest that experimental measurements can inform phylogenetic evolutionary models that are applicable to homologs that span a substantial range of sequence divergence.",Jesse D Bloom,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center

We detail likely capabilities, discuss limitations, and provide novel precautionary strategies to control the spread of gene drives and reverse genomic changes. The ability to edit populations of sexual species would offer substantial benefits to humanity and the environment. For example, RNA-guided gene drives could potentially prevent the spread of disease, support agriculture by reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, and control damaging invasive species.

However, there is concern that the cell cycle phase of a cell might bias characterizations of gene expression at the single-cell level. We assess the effect of cell cycle phase on gene expression in single cells by measuring 333 genes in 930 cells across three phases and three cell lines. We determine each cells phase non-invasively without chemical arrest and use it as a covariate in tests of differential expression. We observe bi-modal gene expression, a previously-described phenomenon, wherein the expression of otherwise abundant genes is either strongly positive, or undetectable within individual cells. This bi-modality is likely both biologically and technically driven. Irrespective of its source, we show that it should be modeled to draw accurate inferences from single cell expression experiments. To this end, we propose a semi-continuous modeling framework based on the generalized linear model, and use it to characterize genes with consistent cell cycle effects across three cell lines. Our new computational framework improves the detection of previously characterized cell-cycle genes compared to approaches that do not account for the bi-modality of single-cell data. We use our semi-continuous modelling framework to estimate single cell gene co-expression networks. These networks suggest that in addition to having phase-dependent shifts in expression (when averaged over many cells), some, but not all, canonical cell cycle genes tend to be co-expressed in groups in single cells. We estimate the amount of single cell expression variability attributable to the cell cycle. We find that the cell cycle explains only 5%-17% of expression variability, suggesting that the cell cycle will not tend to be a large nuisance factor in analysis of the single cell transcriptome.",Raphael  Gottardo,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center

A recent example, the presence and absence of microRNA families, has been vigorously promoted as an ideal source of phylogenetic data and has been applied to several perennial phylogenetic problems. The utility of such data for phylogenetic inference hinges critically both on developing stochastic models that provide a reasonable description of the process that give rise to these data, and also on the careful validation of those models in real inference scenarios. Remarkably, however, the statistical behavior and phylogenetic utility of microRNA data have not yet been rigorously characterized. Here we explore the behavior and performance of microRNA presence/absence data under a variety of evolutionary models and reexamine datasets from several previous studies. We find that highly heterogeneous rates of microRNA gain and loss, pervasive secondary loss, and sampling error collectively render microRNA-based inference of phylogeny difficult. Moreover, our reanalyses fundamentally alter the conclusions for four of the five studies that we reexamined. Our results indicate that the capacity of miRNA data to resolve the tree of life has been overstated, and we urge caution in their application and interpretation.",Robert  Thomson,University of Hawaii at Manoa

Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits that have undergone local adaptation. Using GWAS data, we estimate the mean additive genetic value for a give phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We model the expected differentiation of GWAS loci among populations under neutrality to develop simple tests of selection across an arbitrary number of populations with arbitrary population structure. To find support for the role of specific environmental variables in local adaptation we test for correlations with the estimated genetic values. We also develop a general test of local adaptation to identify overdispersion of the estimated genetic values values among populations. This test is a natural generalization of QST /FST comparisons based on GWAS predictions. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of overdispersion. These tests have considerably greater power than their single locus equivalents due to the fact that they look for positive covariance between like effect alleles. We apply our tests to the human genome diversity panel dataset using GWAS data for six different traits.

Widely used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) models can describe an adaptive process of divergence and selection. However, inference of the dynamics of adaptive landscapes from comparative data is complicated by interpretational difficulties, lack of identifiability among parameter values and the common requirement that adaptive hypotheses must be assigned a priori. Here we develop a reversible-jump Bayesian method of fitting multi-optima OU models to phylogenetic comparative data that estimates the placement and magnitude of adaptive shifts directly from the data. We show how biologically informed hypotheses can be tested against this inferred posterior of shift locations using Bayes Factors to establish whether our a priori models adequately describe the dynamics of adaptive peak shifts. Furthermore, we show how the inclusion of informative priors can be used to restrict models to biologically realistic parameter space and test particular biological interpretations of evolutionary models. We argue that Bayesian model-fitting of OU models to comparative data provides a framework for integrating of multiple sources of biological data--such as microevolutionary estimates of selection parameters and paleontological timeseries--allowing inference of adaptive landscape dynamics with explicit, process-based biological interpretations.",Josef C Uyeda,University of Idaho

However, gene duplication is known to be a rare event in vertebrate genomes and the recruitment of duplicated genes to a novel expression domain (neofunctionalisation) is an even rarer process that requires the evolution of novel combinations of transcription factor binding sites in upstream regulatory regions. Therefore, whilst this hypothesis concerning the evolution of snake venom is therefore very unlikely and should be regarded with caution, it is nonetheless often assumed to be established fact, hindering research into the true origins of snake venom toxins. To critically evaluate this hypothesis we have generated transcriptomic data for body tissues and salivary and venom glands from five species of venomous and non-venomous reptiles. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis of these data reveals that snake venom does not evolve via the hypothesised process of duplication and recruitment of genes encoding body proteins. Indeed, our results show that many proposed venom toxins are in fact expressed in a wide variety of body tissues, including the salivary gland of non-venomous reptiles and that these genes have therefore been restricted to the venom gland following duplication, not recruited. Thus snake venom evolves via the duplication and subfunctionalisation of genes encoding existing salivary proteins. These results highlight the danger of the elegant and intuitive ?just-so story? in evolutionary biology.",John F Mulley,Bangor University

Here, focusing primarily on Island Southeast Asia, we analyze genome-wide data from 56 populations using new methods for tracing ancestral gene flow. We show that all sampled Austronesian groups harbor ancestry that is more closely related to aboriginal Taiwanese than to any present-day mainland population. Surprisingly, western Island Southeast Asian populations have also inherited ancestry from a source nested within the variation of present-day populations speaking Austro-Asiatic languages, which have historically been nearly exclusive to the mainland. Thus, either there was once a substantial Austro-Asiatic presence in Island Southeast Asia, or Austronesian speakers migrated to and through the mainland, admixing there before continuing to western Indonesia.",David  Reich,Harvard Medical School

Some propose that the high mutation rates of STRs in functional genomic regions facilitate evolutionary adaptation. Despite their high mutation rate, some STRs show little to no variation in populations. One such STR occurs in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene PFT1 (MED25), where it encodes an interrupted polyglutamine tract. Though the PFT1 STR is large ([~]270 bp), and thus expected to be extremely variable, it shows only minuscule variation across A. thaliana strains. We hypothesized that the PFT1 STR is under selective constraint, due to previously undescribed roles in PFT1 function. We investigated this hypothesis using plants expressing transgenic PFT1 constructs with either an endogenous STR or with synthetic STRs of varying length. Transgenic plants carrying the endogenous PFT1 STR generally performed best across adult PFT1-dependent traits, in terms of complementing a pft1 null mutant. In stark contrast, transgenic plants carrying a PFT1 transgene lacking the STR entirely phenocopied a pft1 loss-of-function mutant for flowering time phenotypes, and were generally hypomorphic for other traits, establishing the functional importance of this domain. Transgenic plants carrying various synthetic constructs occupied the phenotypic space between wild-type and pft1-loss-of-function mutants. By varying PFT1 STR length, we discovered that PFT1 can act as either an activator or repressor of flowering in a photoperiod-dependent manner. We conclude that the PFT1 STR is constrained to its approximate wild-type length by its various functional requirements. Our study implies that there is strong selection on STRs not only to generate allelic diversity, but also to maintain certain lengths pursuant to optimal molecular function.",Christine  Queitsch,University of Washington

Here we present a novel computational approach for analyzing both mRNA sequence and gene expression data, called MixMir. Our method corrects for 3' UTR background sequence similarity between transcripts, which is known to correlate with mRNA transcript abundance. We demonstrate that after accounting for kmer sequence similarities in 3 UTRs, a statistical linear model based on motif presence/absence can effectively discover active miRNAs in a sample. MixMir utilizes fast software implementations for solving mixed linear models which are widely-used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Essentially we use 3 UTR sequence similarity in place of population cryptic relatedness in the GWAS problem. Compared to similar methods such as miReduce, Sylamer and cWords, we found that MixMir performed better at discovering true miRNA motifs in three mouse Dicer knockout experiments from different tissues, two of which were collected by our group.

In this study, we measure the frequency of different TcRs in CD4+ T cell populations of mice immunized with a complex antigen, killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using high throughput parallel sequencing of the TcR beta chain. In order to track the changes induced by immunisation within this very heterogeneous repertoire, the sequence data were classified by counting the frequency of different clusters of short (3 or 4) continuous stretches of amino acids within the CDR3 repertoire of different mice. Both unsupervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (support vector machine) analysis of these different distributions of sequence clusters differentiated between immunised and unimmunised mice with 100% efficiency. The CD4+ T cell receptor repertoires of mice 5 and 14 days post immunisation were clearly different from that of unimmunised mice, but were not distinguishable from each other. However, the repertoires of mice 60 days post immunisation were distinct both from unimmunised mice, and the day 5/14 animals. Our results reinforce the remarkable diversity of the T cell receptor repertoire, resulting in many diverse private TcRs contributing to the T cell response even in genetically identical mice responding to the same antigen. Finally, specific motifs defined by short sequences of amino acids within the CDR3 region may have a major effect on TcR specificity.

Although of increasing medical importance, little is known about their ecological past, and host associations are underexplored. Previous studies suggest an influence of horizontal gene transfers in ecological niche colonization by acquisition of host pathogenicity genes. We here expand these analyses to metabolic pathways of 28 Bartonella genomes, and experimentally explore the distribution of bartonellae in 21 species of blood-feeding arthropods. Across genomes, repeated gene losses and horizontal gains in the phospholipid pathway were found. The evolutionary timing of these patterns suggests functional consequences likely leading to an early intracellular lifestyle for stem bartonellae. Comparative phylogenomic analyses discover three independent lineage-specific reacquisitions of a core metabolic gene - NAD(P)H-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpsA) - from Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria. Transferred genes are significantly closely related to invertebrate Arsenophonus-, and Serratia-like endosymbionts, and mammalian Helicobacter-like pathogens, supporting a cellular association with arthropods and mammals at the base of extant bartonellae.

Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) provide a good system to understand the molecular and cellular events associated with these processes. Previous work, both in embryos and in culture, has shown how converging signals from both Nodal/TGF{beta}R and Wnt/{beta}-Catenin signalling pathways specify cells to adopt a Primitive Streak like fate and direct them to undertake an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, many of these approaches have relied on genetic analyses without taking into account the temporal progression of events within single cells. In addition, it is still unclear as to what extent events in the embryo are able to be reproduced in culture. Here, we combine flow-cytometry and a quantitative live single-cell imaging approach to demonstrate how the controlled differentiation of mouse ESCs (mESCs) towards a Primitive Streak fate in culture results in cells displaying many of the characteristics observed during early mouse development including transient Brachyury expression, EMT and increased motility. We also find that the EMT initiates the process, and this is both fuelled and terminated by the action of Bra, whose expression is dependent on the EMT and {beta}-Catenin activity. As a consequence of our analysis, we propose that a major output of Brachyury expression is in controlling the velocity of the cells that are transiting out of the Primitive Streak.",David Andrew Turner,University of Cambridge

Hendriksma;Karmi L. Oxman;Sharoni Shafir;,Animal Behavior and Cognition ,2014-08-28,2014-09-02,"Honey bees are important pollinators, requiring floral pollen and nectar for nutrition. Nectar is rich in sugars, but contains additional nutrients, including amino acids (AAs). We tested the preferences of free-flying foragers between 20 AAs at 0.1% w/w in sucrose solutions in an artificial meadow. We found consistent preferences amongst AAs, with essential AAs preferred over nonessential AAs. The preference of foragers correlated negatively with AA induced deviations in pH values, as compared to the control. Next, we quantified tradeoffs between attractive and deterrent AAs at the expense of carbohydrates in nectar. Bees were attracted by phenylalanine, willing to give up 84 units sucrose for 1 unit AA. They were deterred by glycine, and adding 100 or more units of sucrose could resolve to offset 1 unit AA. In addition, we tested physiological effects of AA nutrition on forager homing performance. In a no-choice context, caged bees showed indifference to 0.1% proline, leucine, glycine or phenylanaline in sucrose solutions. Furthermore, flight tests gave no indication that AA nutrition affected flight capacity directly. In contrast, low carbohydrate nutrition reduced the performance of bees, with important methodological implications for homing studies that evaluate the effect of substances that may affect imbibition of sugar solution. In conclusion, low AA concentrations in nectar relative to pollen suggest a limited role in bee nutrition. Most of the 20 AAs evoked a neutral to a mild deterrent response in bees, thus it seems unlikely that bees respond to AAs in nectar as a cue to assess nutritional quality. Nonetheless, free choice behavior of foraging bees is influenced, for instance by phenylalanine and glycine. Thus, AAs in nectar may affect plant-pollinator interactions and thereby exhibit a selective pressure on the flora in the honey bee habitat.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=83 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/008516_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8fde04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@138fdd3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a05775org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cde793_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTS- Amino acids in artificial nectar elicit preferences from honey bee foragers\n- Amino acid identity, pH, and essentiality explain preferences of bees\n- A honey bee forager is willing to pay a premium of carbohydrates for amino acids\n- Carbohydrate nutritional state affects flight performance of foraging bees",Harmen P.

Dick;,Biochemistry ,2014-04-14,2014-08-27,"The degree of oxidation of carbon atoms in organic molecules depends on the covalent structure. In proteins, the average oxidation state of carbon (ZC) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from the chemical formula. To investigate oxidation-reduction (redox) patterns, groups of proteins from different subcellular locations and phylogenetic divisions were selected for comparison. Extracellular proteins of yeast have a relatively high oxidation state of carbon, corresponding with oxidizing conditions outside of the cell. However, an inverse relationship between ZC and redox potential occurs between the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm; this trend is interpreted as resulting from overall coupling of protein turnover to the formation of a lower glutathione redox potential in the cytoplasm. In Rubisco homologues, lower ZC tends to occur in organisms with higher optimal growth temperature, and there are broad changes in ZC in whole-genome protein compositions in microbes from different environments. Energetic costs calculated from thermodynamic models suggest that thermophilic organisms exhibit molecular adaptation to not only high temperature but also the reducing nature of many hydrothermal fluids.

We used mathematical modelling to show that changes in ribosome density should occur along the mRNA at the point of regulation.

For many ectothermic organisms temperature relations shape these patterns, but for terrestrial amphibians, water balance may supersede temperature as the most critical physiologically-limiting factor. Many amphibian species have little resistance to water loss, which restricts them to moist microhabitats and may significantly affect foraging, dispersal, and courtship. Using plaster models as surrogates for terrestrial plethodontid salamanders, we measured water loss under ecologically-relevant field conditions to estimate the duration of surface activity time across the landscape. Surface activity time was significantly affected by topography, solar exposure, canopy cover, maximum air temperature, and time since rain. Spatially, surface activity times were highest in ravine habitats and lowest on ridges. Surface activity time was a significant predictor of salamander abundance, as well as a predictor of successful recruitment; the probability of a juvenile salamander occupying an area with high surface activity time was two times greater than an area with limited predicted surface activity. Our results suggest that survival, recruitment, or both are demographic processes that are affected by water loss and the ability of salamanders to be surface active. Results from our study extend our understanding of plethodontid salamander ecology, emphasize the limitations imposed by their unique physiology, and highlight the importance of water loss to spatial population dynamics. These findings are timely to understanding the effects that fluctuating temperature and moisture conditions predicted for future climates will have on plethodontid salamanders.",William  Peterman,University of Illinois

The population is composed of two morphs (that is, individuals of the same species with different genotypes). In terms of survival and reproductive success, the associated phenotypes differ only in their habitat selection strategies. We compute invasion rates corresponding to the rates at which the abundance of an initially rare morph increases in the presence of the other morph established at equilibrium. If both morphs have positive invasion rates when rare, then there is an equilibrium distribution such that the two morphs coexist; that is, there is a protected polymorphism for habitat selection. Alternatively, if one morph has a negative invasion rate when rare, then it is asymptotically displaced by the other morph under all initial conditions where both morphs are present. We refine the characterization of an evolutionary stable strategy for habitat selection from [Schreiber, 2012] in a mathematically rigorous manner. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an ESS that uses all patches and determine when using a single patch is an ESS. We also provide an explicit formula for the ESS when there are two habitat types. We show that adding environmental stochasticity results in an ESS that, when compared to the ESS for the corresponding model without stochasticity, spends less time in patches with larger carrying capacities and possibly makes use of sink patches, thereby practicing a spatial form of bet hedging.",Alexandru  Hening,Oxford University

Coalescent theory provides an efficient framework for such simulations, but simulating longer regions and higher recombination rates remains challenging. Simulators based on a Markovian approximation to the coalescent scale well, but do not support simulation of selection. Gene conversion is not supported by any published coalescent simulators that support selection.\n\nResultsWe describe cosi2, an efficient simulator that supports both exact and approximate coalescent simulation with positive selection. cosi2 improves on the speed of existing exact simulators, and permits further speedup in approximate mode while retaining support for selection. cosi2 supports a wide range of demographic scenarios including recombination hot spots, gene conversion, population size changes, population structure and migration.\n\ncosi2 implements coalescent machinery efficiently by tracking only a small subset of the Ancestral Recombination Graph, sampling only relevant recombination events, and using augmented skip lists to represent tracked genetic segments. To preserve support for selection in approximate mode, the Markov approximation is implemented not by moving along the chromosome but by performing a standard backwards-in-time coalescent simulation while restricting coalescence to node pairs with overlapping or near-overlapping genetic material. We describe the algorithms used by cosi2 and present comparisons with existing selection simulators.\n\nAvailabilityA free C++ implementation of cosi2 is available at http://broadinstitute.org/[~]ilya/cosi2.\n\nContactilya@broadinstitute.org",Ilya  Shlyakhter,"Broad Institute, Harvard University"

To determine colony nutritional demands, we analyzed a yearly cycle of bee-collected pollen from colonies in the field and compared it to colony worker production and honey bee body composition, for the first time in social insects. We monitored monthly bee production in ten colonies at each of seven sites throughout Israel, and trapped pollen bi-monthly in five additional colonies at each of four of these sites. Pollen mixtures from each sampling date and site were analyzed for weight, total protein, total fatty acids (FAs), and FA composition. Compared to more temperate climates, the eastern Mediterranean allows a relatively high yearly colony growth of ca. 300,000 to 400,000 bees. Colonies at higher elevation above sea level showed lower growth rates. Queen egg-laying rate did not seem to limit growth, as peaks in capped brood areas showed that queens lay a prolific 2,000 eggs a day on average, with up to 3,300 eggs in individual cases. Pollen uptake varied significantly among sites and seasons, with an overall annual mean total 16.8 kg per colony, containing 7.14 kg protein and 677 g fat. Overall mean pollen protein content was high (39.8%), and mean total FA content was 3.8%. Production cost, as expressed by the amount of nutrient used per bee, was least variable for linoleic acid and protein, suggesting these as the best descriptive variables for total number of bees produced. Linolenic acid levels in pollen during the autumn were relatively low, and supplementing colonies with this essential FA may mitigate potential nutritional deficiency. The essentiality of linoleic and linolenic acids was consistent with these FAs tendency to be present at higher levels in collected pollen than in the expected nutrients in bee bodies, demonstrating a well-developed adjustment between pollinator nutritional demands and the nutritional value of food offered by pollinated plants.",Harmen P.

However, we still struggle to incorporate STR variation into genotype-phenotype maps. Here, we review the promise of STRs in contributing to complex trait heritability, and highlight the challenges that STRs pose due to their repetitive nature. We argue that STR variants are more likely than single nucleotide variants to have epistatic interactions, reiterate the need for targeted assays to accurately genotype STRs, and call for more appropriate statistical methods in detecting STR-phenotype associations. Lastly, somatic STR variation within individuals may serve as a read-out of disease susceptibility, and is thus potentially a valuable covariate for future association studies.",Christine  Queitsch,University of Washington

Nevertheless, assembly of complex genomes remains challenging, in part due to the presence of dispersed repeats which introduce ambiguity during genome reconstruction. Transposable elements (TEs) can be particularly problematic, especially for TE families exhibiting high sequence identity, high copy number, or present in complex genomic arrangements. While TEs strongly affect genome function and evolution, most current de novo assembly approaches cannot resolve long, identical, and abundant families of TEs. Here, we applied a novel Illumina technology called TruSeq synthetic long-reads, which are generated through highly parallel library preparation and local assembly of short read data and achieve lengths of 1.5-18.5 Kbp with an extremely low error rate ([~]0.03% per base). To test the utility of this technology, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (reference genome strain y;cn,bw,sp) achieving an N50 contig size of 69.7 Kbp and covering 96.9% of the euchromatic chromosome arms of the current reference genome. TruSeq synthetic long-read technology enables placement of individual TE copies in their proper genomic locations as well as accurate reconstruction of TE sequences. We entirely recovered and accurately placed 4,229 (77.8%) of the 5,434 of annotated transposable elements with perfect identity to the current reference genome. As TEs are ubiquitous features of genomes of many species, TruSeq synthetic long-reads, and likely other methods that generate long reads, offer a powerful approach to improve de novo assemblies of whole genomes.",Rajiv C McCoy,Stanford University

It calculates \""consensus rate\"" between any two samples as how frequently they are grouped together in repeated clustering runs under a certain degree of random perturbation. The pairwise consensus rates form a between-sample similarity matrix, which has been used (1) as a visual proof that clusters exist, (2) for comparing stability among clusters, and (3) for estimating the optimal number (K) of clusters. However, the sensitivity and specificity of CC have not been systemically studied. To assess its performance, we investigated the most common implementations of CC; and compared CC with other popular methods that also focus on cluster stability and estimation of K. We evaluated these methods using simulated datasets with either known structure or known absence of structure. Our results showed that (1) CC was able to divide randomly generated unimodal data into pre-specified numbers of clusters, and was able to show apparent stability of these chance partitions of known cluster-less data; (2) for data with known structure, the proportion of ambiguously clustered (PAC) pairs infers the known number of clusters more reliably than several commonly used K estimating methods; and (3) validation of the optimal K by choosing the most discriminant genes from the discovery cohort and applying them in an independent cohort often exaggerates the confidence in K due to inherent gene-gene correlations among the selected genes. While these results do not yet prove that any of the published studies using CC has generated false positive findings, they show that datasets with subtle or no structure are fully capable of producing strong evidence of consensus clustering. We therefore recommend caution is using CC in class discovery and validation.",Jun Z Li,University of Michigan Ann Arbor

The algorithms generate continuous DNGs, with dot spacing changing in two dimensions along the gradient direction according to arbitrary mathematical functions, with densities ranging from 0.02% to 44.44%.

CGD is an immune deficiency that leads to frequent infections with certain pathogens; this is well documented for S. aureus and A. fumigatus, but less clear for mycobacteria. We therefore performed an extensive literature search which yielded 297 cases of CGD patients with mycobacterial infections; M.bovis BCG was most commonly recovered (74%). The relationship between NOX2 deficiency and BCG infection however has never been studied in a mouse model. We therefore investigated BCG infection in three different mouse models of CGD: Ncf1 mutants in two different genetic backgrounds and NOX2 knock-out mice. In addition we investigated a macrophage-specific rescue (transgenic expression of Ncf1 under the control of the CD68 promoter). Wild type mice did not develop severe disease upon BCG injection. In contrast, all three types of CGD mice were highly susceptible to BCG, as witnessed by a severe weight loss, development of hemorrhagic pneumonia, and a high mortality ([~] 50%). Rescue of NOX2 activity in macrophages restored BCG resistance, similar as seen in wild-type mice. Granulomas from mycobacteria-infected wild type mice generated ROS, while granulomas from CGD mice did not. Bacterial load in CGD mice was only moderately increased, suggesting that it was not crucial for the observed phenotype. CGD mice responded with massively enhanced cytokine release (TNF-, IFN-{gamma}, IL-17 and IL-12) to BCG infection, which might account for severity of the disease. Finally, in wild-type mice, macrophages formed clusters and restricted mycobacteria to granulomas, while macrophages and mycobacteria were diffusely distributed in lung tissue from CGD mice. Our results demonstrate that lack of the NADPH oxidase leads to a markedly increased severity of BCG infection through mechanisms including increased cytokine production and impaired granuloma formation.",Christine  Deffert,Medical Faculty and University of Geneva

How such coupling affects sensory representations and ultimately behavior remains unclear. We investigated the role of neuronal coupling during visual processing using a realistic biophysical model of the vertical system (VS) cell network in the blow fly. These neurons are thought to encode the horizontal rotation axis during rapid free flight manoeuvres. Experimental findings suggest neurons of the vertical system are strongly electrically coupled, and that several downstream neurons driving motor responses to ego-rotation receive inputs primarily from a small subset of VS cells. These downstream neurons must decode information about the axis of rotation from a partial readout of the VS population response. To investigate the role of coupling, we simulated the VS response to a variety of rotating visual scenes and computed optimal Bayesian estimates from the relevant subset of VS cells. Our analysis shows that coupling leads to near-optimal estimates from a subpopulation readout. In contrast, coupling between VS cells has no impact on the quality of encoding in the response of the full population. We conclude that coupling at one level of the fly visual system allows for near-optimal decoding from partial information at the subsequent, pre-motor level. Thus, electrical coupling may provide a general mechanism to achieve near-optimal information transfer from neuronal subpopulations across organisms and modalities.",Krešimir  Josić,University of Houston

By using a mapping approach that is able to identify genetic loci segregating within the lines, we identified four times more loci influencing tameness and aggression than by an approach that assumes fixation of causative alleles, suggesting that many causative loci were not driven to fixation by the selection. We used RNA sequencing in 150 F2 animals to identify hundreds of loci that influence brain gene expression. Several of these loci colocalize with tameness loci and may reflect the same genetic variants. Through analyses of correlations between allele effects on behavior and gene expression, differential expression between the tame and aggressive rat selection lines, and correlations between gene expression and tameness in F2 animals, we identify the genes Gltscr2, Lgi4, Zfp40 and Slc17a7 as candidate contributors to the strikingly different behavior of the tame and aggressive animals.",Henrike  Heyne,University of Leipzig

Whereas nuclear genes are bi-parentally inherited, mitochondrial and chloroplast genes are almost exclusively maternally inherited, and this asymmetry may lead to a bias in the chromosomal distribution of nuclear genes whose products act in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. In particular, because X-linked genes have a higher probability of co-transmission with organellar genes (2/3) compared to autosomal genes (1/2), selection for co-adaptation has been predicted to lead to an over-representation of nuclear-mitochondrial and nuclear-chloroplast genes on the X chromosome relative to autosomes. In contrast, the occurrence of sexually antagonistic organellar mutations might lead to selection for movement of cyto-nuclear genes from the X chromosome to autosomes to reduce male mutation load. Recent broad-scale comparative studies of N-mt distributions in animals have found evidence for these hypotheses in some species, but not others. Here, we use transcriptome sequences to conduct the first study of the chromosomal distribution of cyto-nuclear interacting genes in a plant species with sex chromosomes (Rumex hastatulus; Polygonaceae). We found no evidence of under- or over-representation of either N-mt or N-cp genes on the X chromosome, and thus no support for either the co-adaptation or the sexual-conflict hypothesis. We discuss how our results from a species with recently evolved sex chromosomes fit into an emerging picture of the evolutionary forces governing the chromosomal distribution of nuclear-mitochondrial and nuclear-chloroplast genes.",Stephen I Wright,University of Toronto

Though CentC repeats exhibit considerable diversity both within and among species, little is understood about the mechanisms that drive cen- tromere repeat evolution.

We first validate the existence of long tan- dem arrays of repeats in maize and other taxa in the genus Zea. Although we find considerable sequence diversity among CentC copies genome-wide, genetic similar- ity among repeats is highest within these arrays, suggesting that tandem duplica- tions are the primary mechanism for the generation of new copies. Genetic clustering analyses identify similar sequences among distant repeats, and simulations suggest that this pattern may be due to homoplasious mutation. Although the two ancestral subgenomes of maize have contributed nearly equal numbers of centromeres, our analysis shows that the vast majority of all CentC repeats derive from one of the parental genomes. Finally, by comparing maize with its wild progenitor teosinte, we find that the abundance of CentC has decreased through domestication while the peri- centromeric repeat Cent4 has drastically increased.",Jeffrey  Ross-Ibarra,University of California Davis

Genetic variation in sex chromosomes and ratios of quantities computed from sex chromosomes and autosomes have often been examined in order to infer patterns of sex-biased admixture, typically using statistical approaches that do not mechanistically model the complexity of a sex-specific history of admixture. Here, expanding on a model of Verdu & Rosenberg (2011) that did not include sex specificity, we develop a model that mechanistically examines sex-specific admixture histories. Under the model, multiple source populations contribute to an admixed population, potentially with their male and female contributions varying over time. In an admixed population descended from two source groups, we derive the moments of the distribution of the autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population as a function of sex-specific introgression parameters and time. Considering admixture processes that are constant in time, we demonstrate that surprisingly, although the mean autosomal admixture fraction from a specific source population does not reveal a sex bias in the admixture history, the variance of autosomal admixture is informative about sex bias. Specifically, the long-term variance decreases as the sex bias from a contributing source population increases. This result can be viewed as analogous to the reduction in effective population size for populations with an unequal number of breeding males and females. Our approach can contribute to methods for inference of the history of complex sex-biased admixture processes by enabling consideration of the effect of sex-biased admixture on autosomal DNA.",Amy  Goldberg,Stanford University

To uncover possible {beta}-catenin-independent activities of GSK-3, we generated mammary-specific knock-outs of GSK-3 and {beta}-catenin. Squamous transdifferentiation of the mammary epithelium was largely attenuated, however mammary epithelial cells lost the ability to form mammospheres suggesting perturbation of stem cell properties unrelated to loss of {beta}-catenin alone. At 10 months, adenocarcinomas that developed in glands lacking GSK-3 and {beta}-catenin displayed elevated levels of {gamma}-catenin/plakoglobin as well as activation of the Hedgehog and Notch pathways. Collectively these results establish the two isoforms of GSK-3 as essential integrators of multiple developmental signals that act to maintain normal mammary gland function and suppress tumorigenesis.",James Robert Woodgett,Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute

In particular, sites that are buried and/or have many contacts with other sites in a structure have been shown to evolve more slowly, on average, than surface sites with few contacts. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the extent to which numerous structural properties can predict sequence variation. The quantities we considered include buriedness (as measured by relative solvent accessibility), packing density (as measured by contact number), structural flexibility (as measured by B factors, root-mean-square fluctuations, and variation in dihedral angles), and variability in designed structures. We obtained structural flexibility measures both from molecular dynamics simulations performed on 9 non-homologous viral protein structures and from variation in homologous variants of those proteins, where available. We obtained measures of variability in designed structures from flexible-backbone design in the Rosetta software. We found that most of the structural properties correlate with site variation in the majority of structures, though the correlations are generally weak (correlation coefficients of 0.1 to 0.4). Moreover, we found that buriedness and packing density were better predictors of evolutionary variation than was structural flexibility. Finally, variability in designed structures was a weaker predictor of evolutionary variability than was buriedness or packing density, but it was comparable in its predictive power to the best structural flexibility measures. We conclude that simple measures of buriedness and packing density are better predictors of evolutionary variation than are more complicated predictors obtained from dynamic simulations, ensembles of homologous structures, or computational protein design.",Claus O.

One intriguing feature of the higher-level entity after some major transitions is a division of reproductive labor among its lower-level units. Although it can have clear benefits once established, it is unknown how such reproductive division of labor originates. We consider a recent evolution experiment on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a unique platform to address the issue of reproductive differentiation during an evolutionary transition in individuality. In the experiment, independent yeast lineages evolved a multicellular \""snowflake-like\"" cluster form in response to gravity selection. Shortly after the evolution of clusters, the yeast evolved higher rates of cell death. While cell death enables clusters to split apart and form new groups, it also reduces their performance in the face of gravity selection. To understand the selective value of increased cell death, we create a mathematical model of the cellular arrangement within snowflake yeast clusters. The model reveals that the mechanism of cell death and the geometry of the snowflake interact in complex, evolutionarily important ways. We find that the organization of snowflake yeast imposes powerful limitations on the available space for new cell growth. By dying more frequently, cells in clusters avoid encountering space limitations, and, paradoxically, reach higher numbers. In addition, selection for particular group sizes can explain the increased rate of apoptosis both in terms of total cell number and total numbers of collectives. Thus, by considering the geometry of a primitive multicellular organism we can gain insight into the initial emergence of reproductive division of labor during an evolutionary transition in individuality.",Eric  Libby,Santa Fe Institute

Here we re-evaluate gastropod phylogenetic relationships by collecting new transcriptome data for 40 species and analysing them in combination with publicly available genomes and transcriptomes. Our datasets include all five main gastropod clades: Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia. We use two different methods to assign orthology, subsample each of these matrices into three increasingly dense subsets, and analyse all six of these supermatrices with two different models of molecular evolution. All twelve analyses yield the same unrooted network connecting the five major gastropod lineages. This reduces deep gastropod phylogeny to three alternative rooting hypotheses. These results reject the prevalent hypothesis of gastropod phylogeny, Orthogastropoda.

Although the evolution of stochastic switching has been studied when the environment varies temporally, there has been little theoretical work on the evolution of phenotypic switching under both spatially and temporally fluctuating selection pressures. Here we use a population genetic model to explore the interaction of temporal and spatial variation in the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic switching. We find that spatial variation in selection is important; when selection pressures are similar across space, migration can decrease the rate of switching, but when selection pressures differ spatially, increasing migration between demes can facilitate the evolution of higher rates of switching. These results may help explain the diverse array of non-genetic contributions to phenotypic variability and phenotypic inheritance observed in both wild and experimental populations.",Oana  Carja,Stanford University

Blischak;Julien Roux;Jonathan K. Pritchard;Yoav Gilad;,Genomics ,2014-06-11,2014-09-18,"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression. Recent studies have revealed widespread associations between genetic variation and methylation levels. However, the mechanistic links between genetic variation and methylation remain unclear. To begin addressing this gap, we collected methylation data at [~]300,000 loci in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 64 HapMap Yoruba individuals, and genome-wide bisulfite sequence data in ten of these individuals. We identified (at an FDR of 10%) 11,752 methylation QTLs (meQTLs)--i.e., loci in which genetic variation is associated with changes in DNA methylation. We found that meQTLs are frequently associated with changes in methylation at multiple CpGs across regions of up to 3 kb. Interestingly, meQTLs are also frequently associated with variation in other properties of gene regulation, including histone modifications, DNase I accessibility, chromatin accessibility, and expression levels of nearby genes. These observations suggest that genetic variants may lead to coordinated molecular changes in all of these regulatory phenotypes. One plausible driver of coordinated changes in different regulatory mechanisms is variation in transcription factor (TF) binding. Indeed, we found that SNPs that change predicted TF binding affinities are significantly enriched for associations with DNA methylation at nearby CpGs. Taken together, our observations are consistent with a model whereby changes in TF binding may frequently drive coordinated changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, and gene expression levels.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark that contributes to many biological processes including the regulation of gene expression. Genetic variation has been associated with quantitative changes in DNA methylation (meQTLs). We identified thousands of meQTLs using an assay that allowed us to measure methylation levels at around 300 thousand cytosines. We found that meQTLs are enriched with loci that is also associated with quantitative changes in gene expression, DNase I hypersensitivity, PolII occupancy, and a number of histone marks. This suggests that many molecular events are likely regulated in concert. Finally, we found that changes in transcription factor binding as well as transcription factor abundance are associated with changes in DNA methylation near transcription factor binding sites. Our results indicate that a subset of transcription factors actively regulate DNA methylation levels near their binding sites. This work contributes to our understanding of the regulation of DNA methylation in the larger context of gene regulatory landscape.",Yoav  Gilad,University of Chicago

Here, we sought to determine how mutations affecting the 3' splice site recognition factor U2AF1 alter its normal role in RNA splicing. We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of hundreds of genes, affecting biological pathways such as DNA methylation (DNMT3B), X chromosome inactivation (H2AFY), the DNA damage response (ATR, FANCA), and apoptosis (CASP8). We show that U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3' splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro. Mutations affecting the first and second zinc fingers give rise to different alterations in splice site preference and largely distinct downstream splicing programs. These allele-specific effects are consistent with a computationally predicted model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA. Our findings suggest that U2AF1 mutations contribute to pathogenesis by causing quantitative changes in splicing that affect diverse cellular pathways, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1s zinc finger domains.",Robert K Bradley,FHCRC

Dysregulation of monoallelic gene expression has already been linked to several non-Mendelian inherited genetic disorders. In humans, DNA-methylation is deemed to be an important regulator of monoallelic gene expression, but only few examples are known. One important reason is that current, cost-affordable truly genome-wide methods to assess DNA-methylation are based on sequencing post enrichment. Here, we present a new methodology that combines methylomic data from MethylCap-seq with associated SNP profiles to identify monoallelically methylated loci. Using the Hardy-Weinberg theorem for each SNP locus, it could be established whether the observed frequency of samples featured by biallelic methylation was lower than randomly expected. Applied on 334 MethylCap-seq samples of very diverse origin, this resulted in the identification of 80 genomic regions featured by monoallelic DNA-methylation. Of these 80 loci, 49 are located in genic regions of which 25 have already been linked to imprinting. Further analysis revealed statistically significant enrichment of these loci in promoter regions, further establishing the relevance and usefulness of the method. Additional validation of the found loci was done using 14 whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data sets. Importantly, the developed approach can be easily applied to other enrichment-based sequencing technologies, such as the ChIP-seq-based identification of monoallelic histone modifications.",Sandra  Steyaert,University of Ghent

In doing so, Hsp90 may allow its clients to accumulate mutations as previously proposed by the capacitor hypothesis. If true, Hsp90 clients should show increased evolutionary rate compared to non-clients; however, other factors, such as gene expression and protein connectivity, may confound or obscure the chaperones putative contribution. Here, we compared the evolutionary rates of many Hsp90 clients and non-clients in the human protein kinase superfamily. We show that Hsp90 client status promotes evolutionary rate independently of, but in a small magnitude similar to that of gene expression and protein connectivity. Hsp90s effect on kinase evolutionary rate was detected across mammals, specifically relaxing purifying selection. Hsp90 clients also showed increased nucleotide diversity and harbored more damaging variation than non-client kinases across humans. These results are consistent with the central argument of the capacitor hypothesis that interaction with the chaperone allows its clients to harbor genetic variation. Hsp90 client status is thought to be highly dynamic with as few as one amino acid change rendering a protein dependent on the chaperone. Contrary to this expectation, we found that across protein kinase phylogeny Hsp90 client status tends to be gained, maintained, and shared among closely related kinases. We also infer that the ancestral protein kinase was not an Hsp90 client. Taken together, our results suggest that Hsp90 played an important role in shaping the kinase superfamily.",Christine  Queitsch,University of Washington

However, estimates of selection in noncoding regions conserved across the Brassicaceae family show strong signals of selection. Additionally, we see reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites.  Finally, using expression data from leaf tissue we show that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes.

One method tests for a genome-wide excess of shared derived alleles between taxa using Pattersons D statistic, but does not establish which loci show such an excess or whether the excess is due to introgression or ancestral population structure. Several recent studies have extended the use of D by applying the statistic to small genomic regions, rather than genome-wide. Here, we use simulations and whole genome data from Heliconius butterflies to investigate the behavior of D in small genomic regions. We find that D is unreliable in this situation as it gives inflated values when effective population size is low, causing D outliers to cluster in genomic regions of reduced diversity. As an alternative, we propose a related statistic [Formula] a modified version of a statistic originally developed to estimate the genome-wide fraction of admixture. [Formula] is not subject to the same biases as D, and is better at identifying introgressed loci. Finally, we show that both D and [Formula] outliers tend to cluster in regions of low absolute divergence (dXY), which can confound a recently proposed test for differentiating introgression from shared ancestral variation at individual loci.",Simon H.

Broad-sense heritability estimates differ between the sexes for many common medical disorders, indicating that genetic architecture can be sex-dependent. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified sex-specific and sex-biased effects, where in addition to sex-specific effects on gene expression, twenty-two medical traits have sex-specific or sex-biased loci. Sex-specific genetic architecture of complex traits is also extensively documented in model organisms using genome-wide linkage or association mapping, and in gene disruption studies. The evolutionary origins of sex-specific genetic architecture and sexual dimorphism lie in the fact that males and females share most of their genetic variation yet experience different selection pressures. At the extreme is sexual antagonism, where selection on an allele acts in opposite directions between the sexes. Sexual antagonism has been repeatedly identified via a number of experimental methods in a range of different taxa. Although the molecular basis remains to be identified, mathematical models predict the maintenance of deleterious variants that experience selection in a sex-dependent manner. There are multiple mechanisms by which sexual antagonism and alleles under sex-differential selection could contribute toward the genetics of common, complex disorders. The evidence we review clearly indicates that further research into sex-dependent selection and the sex-specific genetic architecture of diseases would be rewarding. This would be aided by studies of laboratory and wild animal populations, and by modelling sex-specific effects in genome-wide association data with joint, gene-by-sex interaction tests. We predict that even sexually monomorphic diseases may harbour cryptic sex-specific genetic architecture. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that investigating sex-dependent epistasis may be especially rewarding. Finally, the prevalent nature of sex-specific genetic architecture in disease offers scope for the development of more effective, sex-specific therapies.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the European Research Council (WPG and EHM; Starting Grant #280632), a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (EHM), the Swedish Research Council (JKA), and the Volkswagen Foundation (JKA).

However, in vivo experimental support remains inconclusive. Here we develop a minimal spatial mathematical model of glucose-lactate metabolism to examine, in principle, whether metabolic symbiosis is plausible in human tumours, and to assess the potential impact of inhibiting it. We find that symbiosis is a robust feature of our model system--although on the length scale at which oxygen supply is diffusion-limited, its occurrence requires very high cellular metabolic activity--and that necrosis in the tumour core is reduced in the presence of symbiosis. Upon simulating therapeutic inhibition of lactate uptake, we predict that targeted treatment increases the extent of tissue oxygenation without increasing core necrosis. The oxygenation effect is correlated strongly with the extent of wildtype hypoxia and only weakly with wildtype symbiotic behaviour, and therefore may be promising for radiosensitisation of hypoxic, lactate-consuming tumours even if they do not exhibit a spatially well-defined symbiosis. Finally, we conduct a set of in vitro experiments on the U87 glioblastoma cell line to facilitate preliminary speculation as to where highly malignant tumours might fall in our parameter space, and find that these experiments suggest a weakly symbiotic regime for U87 cells, which raises the new question of what relationship exists between symbiosis--if indeed it occurs in vivo--and tumour malignancy.",Jessica  McGillen,University of Oxford

However, the major limitation faced with radio-tagging birds is the size of the animal to which a radio-tag can be attached. We tested how miniature radio-tags affected flight performance and behavior of Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris), possibly the smallest bird species to be fitted with radio-tags. Using eyelash adhesive, we fitted hatch year individuals (n=20 males and 15 females) with faux radio-tags of three sizes varying in mass and antenna length (220mg-12.7cm, 240mg-12.7cm, and 220mg-6.35cm), then filmed the birds in a field aviary to quantify activity budgets. We also estimated flight range using flight simulation models. When the three radio-tag packages were pooled for analysis, the presence of a radio-tag significantly decreased both flight time (-8%) and modeled flight range (-23%) when compared to control birds. However, a multiple comparison analysis between the different packages revealed that there was a significant difference in flight time when the larger radio-tag package (240mg) was attached and no significant difference in flight time when the lighter radio-tag packages (220mg) were attached. Our results are similar to other studies which analyzed the flight time or flight range of birds wearing radio-tags. Therefore, currently available light weight radio-tags ([&le;]220mg) may be a new option to aid in the study of hummingbird biology.

This typically requires aligning the short reads generated to the genome or transcriptome before quantifying expression of pre-defined sets of genes. Differences in the alignment/quantification tools can have a major effect upon the expression levels found with important consequences for biological interpretation. Here we address two main issues: do different analysis pipelines affect the gene expression levels inferred from RNA-seq data? And, how close are the expression levels inferred to the \""true\"" expression levels?\n\nWe evaluate fifty gene profiling pipelines in experimental and simulated data sets with different characteristics (e.g, read length and sequencing depth). In the absence of knowledge of the  ground truth in real RNAseq data sets, we used simulated data to assess the differences between the \""true\"" expression and those reconstructed by the analysis pipelines. Even though this approach does not take into account all known biases present in RNAseq data, it still allows to estimate the accuracy of the gene expression values inferred by different analysis pipelines. The results show that i) overall there is a high correlation between the expression levels inferred by the best pipelines and the true quantification values; ii) the error in the estimated gene expression values can vary considerably across genes; and iii) a small set of genes have expression estimates with consistently high error (across data sets and methods). Finally, although the mapping software is important, the quantification method makes a greater difference to the results.",Alvis  Brazma,EMBL-EBI

Published assessments and benchmark datasets for protein and, to a lesser extent, global nucleotide MSAs are available, but less effort has been made to establish benchmarks in the more general problem of whole genome alignment (WGA).\n\nResultsUsing the same model as the successful Assemblathon competitions, we organized a competitive evaluation in which teams submitted their alignments, and assessments were performed collectively after all the submissions were received. Three datasets were used: two of simulated primate and mammalian phylogenies, and one of 20 real fly genomes. In total 35 submissions were assessed, submitted by ten teams using 12 different alignment pipelines.\n\nConclusionsWe found agreement between independent simulation-based and statistical assessments, indicating that there are substantial accuracy differences between contemporary alignment tools. We saw considerable difference in the alignment quality of differently annotated regions, and found few tools aligned the duplications analysed. We found many tools worked well at shorter evolutionary distances, but fewer performed competitively at longer distances. We provide all datasets, submissions and assessment programs for further study, and provide, as a resource for future benchmarking, a convenient repository of code and data for reproducing the simulation assessments.",Benedict  Paten,"University of California, Santa Cruz"

Our analysis reveals that persistence requires that the geometric mean of fitness at low densities is greater than one. When this geometric mean is less than one, asymptotic extinction occurs with high probability for low initial population densities. Additionally, if the population only experiences positive density-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence occurs provided the geometric mean of fitness at high population densities is greater than one. However, if the population experiences both positive and negative density-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence only occurs if environmental fluctuations are sufficiently small. We illustrate counter-intuitively that environmental fluctuations can increase the probability of persistence when populations are initially at low densities, and can cause asymptotic extinction of populations experiencing intermediate predation rates despite conditional persistence occurring at higher predation rates.",Sebastian  Schreiber,"University of California, Davis"

Seasonal influenza vaccines are prone to production problems and low efficacies, while pandemic vaccines are unlikely to be available in time to slow a rapidly spreading global outbreak. Antiviral therapy was found to be beneficial during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic even with limited use; however, antiviral use has decreased further since then. We seek to determine the role antiviral therapy can play in pandemic and seasonal influenza control on the population level, and to find optimized strategies for more efficient use of treatment.

Resistance of some organisms to ice formation and growth, either in subtidal environments (e.g. Antarctic anchor ice), or in environments with moisture and cold air (e.g. plants, intertidal) begs examination of how this is accomplished. Several factors may be important in promoting or mitigating ice formation. As a start, here we examine the effect of surface texture alone. We tested four candidate surfaces, inspired by hard-shelled marine invertebrates and constructed using a three-dimensional printing process. We screened biological and artifical samples for ice formation and accretion in submerged conditions using previous methods, and developed a new test to examine ice formation from surface droplets as might be encountered in environments with moist, cold air. It appears surface texture plays only a small role in delaying the onset of ice formation: a stripe feature (corresponding to patterning found on valves of blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, or on the spines of the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri) slowed ice formation an average of 25% compared to a grid feature (corresponding to patterning found on sub-polar butterclams, Saxidomas nuttalli). The geometric dimensions of the features have only a small ([~]6%) effect on ice formation. Surface texture affects ice formation, but does not explain by itself the large variation in ice formation and species-specific ice resistance observed in other work.

Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis. Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few  driver mutations occur alongside thousands of random  passenger mutations--a natural consequence of cancers elevated mutation rate. Some passengers can be deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression that is described by a critical population size, below which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers meltdown. We find support for the model in cancer age-incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to rationalize successes and failures of different treatment strategies. We find that a tumors load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies. The collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated by both current and future therapies.",Leonid A Mirny,Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Silver;,Microbiology ,2014-08-08,2014-09-30,"Bacterial from several taxa, including Kurthia zopfii, Myxococcus xanthus, and Bacillus mycoides, have been reported to align growth of their colonies to small features on the surface of solid media, including anisotropies created by compression. While the function of this phenomenon is unclear, it may help organisms navigate on solid phases, such as soil. The origin of this behavior is also unknown: it may be biological (that is, dependent on components that sense the environment and regulate growth accordingly) or merely physical.\n\nHere we show that B. subtilis, an organism that typically does not respond to media compression, can be induced to do so with two simple and synergistic perturbations: a mutation that maintains cells in the swarming (chained) state, and the addition of EDTA to the growth media, which further increases chain length. EDTA apparently increases chain length by inducing defects in cell separation, as the treatment has only marginal effects on the length of individual cells.\n\nThese results lead us to three conclusions. First, the wealth of genetic tools available to B. subtilis will provide a new, tractable chassis for engineering compression sensitive organisms. Second, the sensitivity of colony morphology to media compression in Bacillus is a physical rather than biological phenomenon dependent on a simple physical property of rod-shaped cells. And third, colony morphology under compression holds promise as a rapid, simple, and low-cost way to screen for changes in the length of rod-shaped cells or chains thereof.",Pamela A.

The only currently accepted method for this is a  more is worse paradigm by which clinicians measure CTC burden before and after treatment to assess efficacy. Research efforts are currently focused almost entirely on genetic classification of these cells, which has yet to bear any fruit translationally. We suggest that we should shift the focus of our investigation to one driven by a physical sciences perspective. Specifically, by understanding the vascular system as a network of interconnected organs and capillary beds as filters that capture CTCs. By ascertaining the distribution of CTCs in this network for individual patients, information about the existence of subclinical metastatic disease, and therefore metastatic propensity, will come to light, and allow for better staging, prognostication and rational use of organ-directed therapy in the setting of oligometastatic disease.\n\nAbstractO_ST_ABSPurposeC_ST_ABSResearch into mechanisms of hematogenous metastasis has largely become genetic in focus, attempting to understand the molecular basis of  seed-soil relationships. However, preceding this biological mechanism is the physical process of dissemination of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in the circulatory network. We utilize a novel, network perspective of hematogenous metastasis and a large dataset on metastatic patterns to shed new light on this process.\n\nExperimental DesignThe metastatic efficiency index (MEI), previously suggested by Weiss, quantifies the process of hematogenous metastasis by taking the ratio of metastatic incidence for a given primary-target organ pair and the relative blood flow between the two sites. In this paper we extend the methodology by taking into account the reduction in CTC number that occurs in capillary beds and a novel network model of CTC flow.\n\nResultsBy applying this model to a dataset of metastatic incidence, we show that the MEI depends strongly on the assumptions of micrometastatic lesions in the lung and liver. Utilizing this framework we can represent different configurations of metastatic disease and offer a rational method for identifying patients with oligometastatic disease for inclusion in future trials.\n\nConclusionsWe show that our understanding of the dynamics of CTC flow is significantly lacking, and that this specifically precludes our ability to predict metastatic patterns in individual patients. Our formalism suggests an opportunity to go a step further in metastatic disease characterization by including the distribution of CTCs at staging, offering a rational method of trial design for oligometastatic disease.",Jacob G Scott,H.

Nevertheless, numerous analyses of the first riboprofiling dataset have produced equivocal and often incompatible results. Here we analyze three independent yeast riboprofiling data sets, including two with much higher coverage than previously available, and find that all three show substantial technical sequence biases that confound interpretations of ribosomal occupancy. After accounting for these biases, we find no effect of previously implicated factors on ribosomal pausing. Rather, we find that incorporation of proline, whose unique side-chain stalls peptide synthesis in vitro, also slows the ribosome in vivo. We also reanalyze a recent method that reported positively charged amino acids as the major determinant of ribosomal stalling and demonstrate that its assumptions lead to false signals of stalling in low-coverage data. Our results suggest that any analysis of riboprofiling data should account for sequencing biases and sparse coverage. To this end, we establish a robust methodology that enables analysis of ribosome profiling data without prior assumptions regarding which positions spanned by the ribosome cause stalling.",Hunter B.

We consider a general reconstruction setting complicated by the presence of noise in the data due to biological variation, as well as experimental or measurement errors. To improve tolerance to noise we define and use a shrinkage-like estimator. We prove the correctness of our algorithm by showing asymptotic convergence to the correct tree under mild constraints on the level of noise. Moreover, on synthetic data, we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, that it is efficient even with a relatively small number of samples and that its performance quickly converges to its asymptote as the number of samples increases.

In this assay the histone mark of interest is enriched through a chromatin pull-down assay using an antibody for the mark. Due to imperfect antibodies and other factors, many of the sequenced fragments do not originate from the histone mark of interest, and are referred to as background reads. Background reads are not uniformly distributed and therefore control samples are usually used to estimate the background distribution at any given genomic position. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium guidelines suggest sequencing a whole cell extract (WCE, or \""input\"") sample, or a mock ChIP reaction such as an IgG control, as a background sample. However, for a histone modification ChIP-seq investigation it is also possible to use a Histone H3 (H3) pull-down to map the underlying distribution of histones.\n\nIn this paper we generated data from a hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell population isolated from mouse foetal liver to compare WCE and H3 ChIP-seq as control samples. The quality of the control samples is estimated by a comparison to pull-downs of histone modifications and to expression data. We find minor differences between WCE and H3 ChIP-seq, such as coverage in mitochondria and behaviour close to transcription start sites. Where the two controls differ, the H3 pull-down is generally more similar to the ChIP-seq of histone modifications. However, the differences between H3 and WCE have a negligible impact on the quality of a standard analysis.",Alicia  Oshlack,"1Bioinformatics Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"

A sexually dimorphic response was found, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) associated with substantially greater epigenetic dysregulation in males but large for gestational age (LGA) growth affecting females predominantly.

Weissman;Leonid Kruglyak;,Genetics ,2014-03-16,2014-10-23,"Heritable differences in gene expression between individuals are an important source of phenotypic variation. The question of how closely the effects of genetic variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open. Here, we addressed this question by using ribosome profiling to examine how genetic differences between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect translation. Strain differences in translation were observed for hundreds of genes. Allele specific measurements in the diploid hybrid between the two strains revealed roughly half as many cis-acting effects on translation as were observed for mRNA levels. In both the parents and the hybrid, most effects on translation were of small magnitude, such that the direction of an mRNA difference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint difference. The relative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint levels was similar to that for mRNA levels. There was a tendency for translation to cause larger footprint differences than expected given the respective mRNA differences. This is in contrast to translational differences between yeast species that have been reported to more often oppose than reinforce mRNA differences. Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation termination in the two yeast strains and also found several instances where erroneous reference gene annotations lead to apparent nonsense mutations that in fact reside outside of the translated gene body. Overall, genetic influences on translation subtly modulate gene expression differences, and translation does not create strong discrepancies between genetic influences on mRNA and protein levels.\n\nAuthor summaryIndividuals in a species differ from each other in many ways. For many traits, a fraction of this variation is genetic - it is caused by DNA sequence variants in the genome of each individual. Some of these variants influence traits by altering how much certain genes are expressed, i.e. how many mRNA and protein molecules are made in different individuals. Surprisingly, earlier work has found that the effects of genetic variants on mRNA and protein levels for the same genes appear to be very different. Many variants appeared to influence only mRNA (but not protein) levels, and vice versa. In this paper, we studied this question by using a technique called \""ribosome profiling\"" to measure translation (the cellular process of reading mRNA molecules and synthesizing protein molecules) in two yeast strains. We found that the genetic differences between these two strains influence translation for hundreds of genes. Because most of these effects were small in magnitude, they explain at most a small fraction of the discrepancies between the effects of genetic variants on mRNA and protein levels.",Frank W.

Many measures have been proposed to summarise these correlations and of these the correlation index is widely used and is the standard in studies of spontaneous retinal activity. We show that this measure has two undesirable properties: it is unbounded above and confounded by firing rate. We list properties needed for a measure to fairly quantify and compare correlations and we propose a novel measure of correlation -- the Spike Time Tiling Coefficient. This coefficient, the correlation index and 33 other measures of correlation of spike times are blindly tested for the required properties on synthetic and experimental data. On the basis of this, we propose a measure (the Spike Time Tiling Coefficient) to replace the correlation index. To demonstrate the benefits of this measure, we re-analyse data from seven key studies which previously used the correlation index to investigate the nature of spontaneous activity. We re-analyse data from {beta}2(KO) and {beta}2(TG) mutants, mutants lacking connexin isoforms and also the age-dependent changes in wild type and {beta}2(KO) correlations. Re-analysis of the data using the proposed measure can significantly change the conclusions. It leads to better quantification of correlations and therefore better inference from the data. We hope that the proposed measure will have wide applications, and will help clarify the role of activity in retinotopic map formation.",Catherine Sarah Cutts,University of Cambridge

Quantifying the turnover of these cellular subclasses can provide important insights into the viral life cycle and the generation and maintenance of latently infected cells. We used previously published data from five patients chronically infected with HIV-1 that initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Patient-matched PCR for unspliced and multiply spliced viral RNAs combined with limiting dilution analysis provided measurements of transcriptional profiles at the single cell level. Furthermore, measurement of intracellular transcripts and extracellular virion-enclosed HIV-1 RNA allowed us to distinguish productive from non-productive cells. We developed a mathematical model describing the dynamics of plasma virus and the transcriptional subclasses of HIV-1-infected cells. Fitting the model to the data allowed us to better understand the phenotype of different transcriptional subclasses and their contribution to the overall turnover of HIV-1 before and during cART. The average number of virus-producing cells in peripheral blood is small during chronic infection (25.7 cells ml-1). We find that 14.0%, 0.3% and 21.2% of infected cells become defectively, latently and persistently infected cells, respectively. Assuming that the infection is homogenous throughout the body, we estimate an average in vivo viral burst size of 2.1 x 104 virions per cell. Our study provides novel quantitative insights into the turnover and development of different subclasses of HIV-1-infected cells. The model predicts that the pool of latently infected cells becomes rapidly established during the first months of acute infection and continues to increase slowly during the first years of chronic infection. Having a detailed understanding of this process will be useful for the evaluation of viral eradication strategies that aim to deplete the latent reservoir of HIV-1.\n\nAuthor SummaryGaining a quantitative understanding of the development and turnover of different HIV-1-infected subpopulations of cells is crucial to improve the outcome of patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). The population of latently infected cells is of particular interest as they represent the major barrier to a cure of HIV-1 infection. We developed a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of different transcriptionally active subclasses of HIV-1-infected cells and the viral load in peripheral blood. The model was fitted to previously published data from five chronically HIV-1-infected patients starting cART. This allowed us to estimate critical parameters of the within-host dynamics of HIV-1, such as the the number of virions produced by a single infected cell. The model further allowed investigation of HIV-1 dynamics during the acute phase. Computer simulations predict that latently infected cells become rapidly established during the first months of acute infection and continue to increase slowly during the first years of chronic infection. This illustrates the opportunity for strategies that aim to eradicate the virus during early cART as the pool of HIV-1 infected cells is substantially smaller during acute infection than during chronic infection.",Christian L Althaus,University of Bern

Novel cellulolytic enzymes have been discovered from microbial genomes and metagenomes of microbial communities. However, the identification of relevant genes without known homologs, and elucidation of the lignocellulolytic pathways and protein complexes for different microorganisms remain a challenge.\n\nResultsWe describe a new computational method for the targeted discovery of functional modules of plant biomass-degrading protein families based on their co-occurrence patterns across genomes and metagenome datasets, and the strength of association of these modules with the genomes of known degraders. From more than 6.4 million family annotations for 2884 microbial genomes and 332 taxonomic bins from 18 metagenomes, we identified five functional modules that are distinctive for plant biomass degraders, which we call plant biomass degradation modules (PDMs). These modules incorporated protein families involved in the degradation of cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins, structural components of the cellulosome and additional families with potential functions in plant biomass degradation. The PDMs could be linked to 81 gene clusters in genomes of known lignocellulose degraders, including previously described clusters of lignocellulolytic genes. On average, 70% of the families of each PDM mapped to gene clusters in known degraders, which served as an additional confirmation of their functional relationships. The presence of a PDM in a genome or taxonomic metagenome bin allowed us to predict an organisms ability for plant biomass degradation accurately. For 15 draft genomes of a cow rumen metagenome, we validated by cross-linking with confirmed cellulolytic enzymes that the PDMs identified plant biomass degraders within a complex microbial community.\n\nConclusionsFunctional modules of protein families that realize different aspects of plant cell wall degradation can be inferred from co-occurrence patterns across (meta)genomes with a probabilistic topic model. The PDMs represent a new resource of protein families and candidate genes implicated in microbial plant biomass degradation. They can be used to predict the ability to degrade plant biomass for a genome or taxonomic bin. The method would also be suitable for characterizing other microbial phenotypes.",Alice Carolyn McHardy,Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf

Here we show how high-resolution genetic markers can be used to identify populations of a migratory bird, the Wilsons warbler (Cardellina pusilla), at fine enough spatial scales to facilitate assessing regional drivers of demographic trends. By screening 1626 samples using 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected from a large pool of candidates ([~]450,000), we identify novel region-specific migratory routes and timetables of migration along the Pacific Flyway.

Many studies over the past decade have utilized reference genome sequences of numerous species to characterize the prevalence and contribution of nuclear mitochondrial insertions to human diseases. The recent advancement of high throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the interrogation of genomic variation at a much finer scale, and now allows for an exploration into the diversity of polymorphic nuclear mitochondrial insertions (NumtS) in human populations. We have developed an approach to discover and genotype previously undiscovered Numt insertions using whole genome, paired-end sequencing data. We have applied this method to almost a thousand individuals in twenty populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other data sets and identified 138 novel sites of Numt insertions, extending our current knowledge of existing Numt locations in the human genome by almost 20%. Most of the newly identified NumtS were found in less than 1% of the samples we examined, suggesting that they occur infrequently in nature or have been rapidly removed by purifying selection. We find that recent Numt insertions are derived from throughout the mitochondrial genome, including the D-loop, and have integration biases consistent with previous studies on older, fixed NumtS in the reference genome. We have further determined the complete inserted sequence for a subset of these events to define their age and origin of insertion as well as their potential impact on studies of mitochondrial heteroplasmy.",Ryan E Mills,University ofMichigan

Lyon;,Bioinformatics ,2014-06-10,2014-10-28,"BackgroundINDELs, especially those disrupting protein-coding regions of the genome, have been strongly associated with human diseases. However, there are still many errors with INDEL variant calling, driven by library preparation, sequencing biases, and algorithm artifacts.\n\nMethodsWe characterized whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), and PCR-free sequencing data from the same samples to investigate the sources of INDEL errors. We also developed a classification scheme based on the coverage and composition to rank high and low quality INDEL calls. We performed a large-scale validation experiment on 600 loci, and find high-quality INDELs to have a substantially lower error rate than low quality INDELs (7% vs. 51%).\n\nResultsSimulation and experimental data show that assembly based callers are significantly more sensitive and robust for detecting large INDELs (>5 bp) than alignment based callers, consistent with published data. The concordance of INDEL detection between WGS and WES is low (52%), and WGS data uniquely identifies 10.8-fold more high-quality INDELs. The validation rate for WGS-specific INDELs is also much higher than that for WES-specific INDELs (85% vs. 54%), and WES misses many large INDELs. In addition, the concordance for INDEL detection between standard WGS and PCR-free sequencing is 71%, and standard WGS data uniquely identifies 6.3-fold more low-quality INDELs. Furthermore, accurate detection with Scalpel of heterozygous INDELs requires 1.2-fold higher coverage than that for homozygous INDELs. Lastly, homopolymer A/T INDELs are a major source of low-quality INDEL calls, and they are highly enriched in the WES data.\n\nConclusionsOverall, we show that accuracy of INDEL detection with WGS is much greater than WES even in the targeted region. We calculated that 60X WGS depth of coverage from the HiSeq platform is needed to recover 95% of INDELs detected by Scalpel. While this is higher than current sequencing practice, the deeper coverage may save total project costs because of the greater accuracy and sensitivity. Finally, we investigate sources of INDEL errors (e.g. capture deficiency, PCR amplification, homopolymers) with various data that will serve as a guideline to effectively reduce INDEL errors in genome sequencing.",Gholson J.

By combining the power of mapping and assembly, Scalpel searches the de Bruijn graph for sequence paths (contigs) that span each exon. The algorithm creates a single path for exons with no INDEL, two paths for an exon with a heterozygous mutation, and multiple paths for more exotic variations. A detailed repeat composition analysis coupled with a self-tuning k-mer strategy allows Scalpel to outperform other state-of-the-art approaches for INDEL discovery. We extensively compared Scalpel with a battery of >10000 simulated and >1000 experimentally validated INDELs between 1 and 100bp against two recent algorithms for INDEL discovery: GATK HaplotypeCaller and SOAPindel. We report anomalies for these tools in their ability to detect INDELs, especially in regions containing near-perfect repeats which contribute to high false positive rates. In contrast, Scalpel demonstrates superior specificity while maintaining high sensitivity. We also present a large-scale application of Scalpel for detecting de novo and transmitted INDELs in 593 families with autistic children from the Simons Simplex Collection. Scalpel demonstrates enhanced power to detect long ([&ge;]20bp) transmitted events, and strengthens previous reports of enrichment for de novo likely gene-disrupting INDEL mutations in children with autism with many new candidate genes.

Histograms of k-mer frequencies can give valuable insight into the underlying distribution and indicate the error rate and genome size sampled in the sequencing experiment.\n\nResults: We present KmerStream, a streaming algorithm for computing statistics for high throughput sequencing data based on the frequency of k-mers. The algorithm runs in time linear in the size of the input and the space requirement are logarithmic in the size of the input. This very low space requirement allows us to deal with much larger datasets than previously presented algorithms. We derive a simple model that allows us to estimate the error rate of the sequencing experiment, as well as the genome size, using only the aggregate statistics reported by KmerStream and validate the accuracy on sequences from a PhiX control.\n\nAs an application we show how KmerStream can be used to compute the error rate of a DNA sequencing experiment. We run KmerStream on a set of 2656 whole genome sequenced individuals and compare the error rate to quality values reported by the sequencing equipment. We discover that while the quality values alone are largely reliable as a predictor of error rate, there is considerable variability in the error rates between sequencing runs, even when accounting for reported quality values.\n\nAvailability: The tool KmerStream is written in C++ and is released under a GPL license.

This issue is highlighted by recent works that have rested controversial claims upon sequencing data that appear to support the presence of unexpected exogenous species.\n\nResultsI used reads that preferentially aligned to alternate genomes to infer the distribution of potential contaminant species in a set of independent sequencing experiments. I confirmed that dilute samples are more exposed to contaminating DNA, and, focusing on four single-cell sequencing experiments, found that these contaminants appear to originate from a wide diversity of clades. Although negative control libraries prepared from  blank samples recovered the highest-frequency contaminants, low-frequency contaminants, which appeared to make heterogeneous contributions to samples prepared in parallel within a single experiment, were not well controlled for. I used these results to show that, despite heavy replication and plausible controls, contamination can explain all of the observations used to support a recent claim that complete genes pass from food to human blood.\n\nConclusionsContamination must be considered a potential source of signals of exogenous species in sequencing data, even if these signals are replicated in independent experiments, vary across conditions, or indicate a species which seems a priori unlikely to contaminate. Negative control libraries processed in parallel are essential to control for contaminant DNAs, but their limited ability to recover low-frequency contaminants must be recognized.",Richard W Lusk,University of Michigan

Bolon;,Evolutionary Biology ,2014-10-23,2014-11-03,"Mutations are the source of evolutionary variation. The interactions of multiple mutations can have important effects on fitness and evolutionary trajectories. We have recently described the distribution of fitness effects of all single mutations for a nine amino acid region of yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) implicated in substrate binding. Here, we report and discuss the distribution of intragenic epistatic effects within this region in seven Hsp90 point mutant backgrounds of neutral to slightly deleterious effect, resulting in an analysis of more than 1000 double-mutants. We find negative epistasis between substitutions to be common, and positive epistasis to be rare - resulting in a pattern that indicates a drastic change in the distribution of fitness effects one step away from the wild type. This can be well explained by a concave relationship between phenotype and genotype (i.e., a concave shape of the local fitness landscape), suggesting mutational robustness intrinsic to the local sequence space. Structural analyses indicate that, in this region, epistatic effects are most pronounced when a solvent-inaccessible position is involved in the interaction. In contrast, all 18 observations of positive epistasis involved at least one mutation at a solvent-exposed position. By combining the analysis of evolutionary and biophysical properties of an epistatic landscape, these results contribute to a more detailed understanding of the complexity of protein evolution.",Claudia  Bank,EPFL

Recent work has introduced explicit models for the geographic distribution of genetic variation and has shown that such explicit models yield superior accuracy in ancestry inference over non-model-based methods. Here we extend such work to introduce a method that models admixture between ancestors from multiple sources across a geographic continuum. We devise efficient algorithms based on hidden Markov models to localize on a map the recent ancestors (e.g. grandparents) of admixed individuals, joint with assigning ancestry at each locus in the genome. We validate our methods using empirical data from individuals with mixed European ancestry from the POPRES study and show that our approach is able to localize their recent ancestors within an average of 470Km of the reported locations of their grandparents. Furthermore, simulations from real POPRES genotype data show that our method attains high accuracy in localizing recent ancestors of admixed individuals in Europe (an average of 550Km from their true location for localization of 2 ancestries in Europe, 4 generations ago). We explore the limits of ancestry localization under our approach and find that performance decreases as the number of distinct ancestries and generations since admixture increases. Finally, we build a map of expected localization accuracy across admixed individuals according to the location of origin within Europe of their ancestors.\n\nAuthor SummaryInferring ancestry from genetic data forms a fundamental problem with applications ranging from localizing disease genes to inference of human history. Recent approaches have introduced models of genetic variation as a function of geography and have shown that such models yield high accuracies in ancestry inference from genetic data.

One such animal, Peromyscus eremicus, is native to the desert regions of the southwest United States and may live its entire life without oral fluid intake. As a first step toward understanding the genetics that underlie this phenotype, we present a characterization of the P. eremicus transcriptome.

While the current reference genome sequence is of very high quality, gaps and misassemblies remain due to biological and technical complexities. Large repetitive sequences and complex allelic diversity are the two main drivers of assembly error. Although increasing the length of sequence reads and library fragments can help overcome these problems, even the longest available reads do not resolve all regions of the human genome. In order to overcome the issue of allelic diversity, we used genomic DNA from an essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1. We utilized several resources from this DNA including a set of end-sequenced and indexed BAC clones, an optical map, and 100X whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequence coverage using short (lllumina) read pairs. We used the WGS sequence and the GRCh37 reference assembly to create a sequence assembly of the CHM1 genome. We subsequently incorporated 382 finished CHORI-17 BAC clone sequences to generate a second draft assembly, CHM1_1.1 (NCBI AssemblyDB GCA_000306695.2). Analysis of gene and repeat content show this assembly to be of excellent quality and contiguity, and comparisons to ClinVar and the NHGRI GWAS catalog show that the CHM1 genome does not harbor an excess of deleterious alleles. However, comparison to assembly-independent resources, such as BAC clone end sequences and long reads generated by a different sequencing technology (PacBio), indicate misassembled regions. The great majority of these regions is enriched for structural variation and segmental duplication, and can be resolved in the future by sequencing BAC clone tiling paths.

To illustrate our findings, we examined the interplay between selection and demography in two species of Peromyscus mice, for which we have independent evidence of selection acting on phenotype as well as functional evidence identifying the underlying genotype. With this unusual information, we tested whether population-genetic-based approaches could have been utilized to identify the adaptive locus. Contrary to published claims, we conclude that the use of the background site frequency spectrum as a null model is largely ineffective in bottlenecked populations. Results are quantified both for site frequency spectrum and linkage disequilibrium-based predictions, and are found to hold true across a large parameter space that encompasses many species and populations currently under study. These results suggest that the genomic footprint left by selection on both new and standing variation in strongly bottlenecked populations will be difficult, if not impossible, to find using current approaches.",Yu-Ping  Poh,UMass Medical School

However, gene family curation is often only inferred from DNA sequence homology and lacks insights into evolutionary processes contributing to gene family dynamics. In a comparative genomics framework, we integrated multiple lines of evidence provided by gene synteny, sequence homology and protein-based Hidden Markov Modelling to extract homologous super-clusters composed of multi-domain resistance (R)-proteins of the NB-LRR type (for NUCLEOTIDE BINDING/LEUCINE-RICH REPEATS), that are involved in plant innate immunity. To assess the diversity of R-proteins within and between species, we screened twelve eudicot plant genomes including six major crops and found a total of 2,363 NB-LRR genes. Our curated R-proteins set shows a 50% average for tandem duplicates and a 22% fraction of gene copies retained from ancient polyploidy events (ohnologs). We provide evidence for strong positive selection acting on all identified genes and show significant differences in molecular evolution rates (Ka/Ks-ratio) among tandem- (mean = 1.59), ohnolog (mean = 1.36) and singleton (mean = 1.22) R-gene duplicates. To foster the process of gene-edited plant breeding, we report species-specific presence/absence of all 140 NB-LRR genes present in the model plant Arabidopsis and describe four distinct clusters of NB-LRR \""gatekeeper\"" loci sharing syntelogs across all analyzed genomes. In summary, we designed and implemented an easy-to-follow computational framework for super-gene family identification, and provide the most curated set of NB-LRR genes whose genetic versatility among twelve lineages can underpin crop improvement.",M.

Herein, we perform genome-wide CNV analysis in 12 diversified chicken genomes based on whole genome sequencing. A total of 9,025 CNV regions (CNVRs) covering 100.1 Mb and representing 9.6% of the chicken genome are identified, ranging in size from 1.1 to 268.8 kb with an average of 11.1 kb. Sequencing-based predictions are confirmed at high validation rate by two independent approaches, including array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The Pearson?s correlation values between sequencing and aCGH results range from 0.395 to 0.740, and qPCR experiments reveal a positive validation rate of 91.71% and a false negative rate of 22.43%. In total, 2,188 predicted CNVRs (24.2%) span 2,182 RefSeq genes (36.8%) associated with specific biological functions. Besides two previously accepted copy number variable genes EDN3 and PRLR, we also find some promising genes with potential in phenotypic variants. FZD6 and LIMS1, two genes related to diseases susceptibility and resistance are covered by CNVRs. Highly duplicated SOCS2 may lead to higher bone mineral density. Entire or partial duplication of some genes like POPDC3 and LBFABP may have great economic importance in poultry breeding.

We found that Msi genes are rarely mutated but frequently overexpressed in human cancers, and associated with an epithelial-luminal cell state. Using ribosome footprint profiling and RNA-seq analysis of genetic mouse models in neuronal and mammary cell types, we found that Msis regulate translation of genes implicated in epithelial cell biology and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promote an epithelial splicing pattern. Overexpression of Msi proteins inhibited translation of genes required for EMT, including Jagged1, and repressed EMT in cell culture and in mammary gland in vivo, while knockdown in epithelial cancer cells led to loss of epithelial identity. Our results show that mammalian Msi proteins contribute to an epithelial gene expression program and promote an epithelial-luminal state in both neural and breast cell types.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMsi proteins bind UAG motifs in vitro and in 3 UTRs of mRNAs\nC_LIO_LIMsi proteins are markers of epithelial state in brain and breast tumors, and cell lines\nC_LIO_LIThe Notch regulator Jag1 mRNA is bound and translationally repressed by Msi\nC_LIO_LIMsi overexpression represses EMT in the mammary gland in vivo\nC_LI",Yarden  Katz,MIT

While recent efforts have identified thousands of new long non-coding (lnc) RNAs and demonstrated a complex transcriptional repertoire produced by protein-coding (pc) genes, limited progress has been made in distinguishing functional RNA from spurious transcription events. This is partly due to present RNA classification, which is typically based on technical rather than biochemical criteria. Here we devise a strategy to systematically categorize human RNAs by their sensitivity to the ribonucleolytic RNA exosome complex and by the nature of their transcription initiation. These measures are surprisingly effective at correctly classifying annotated transcripts, including lncRNAs of known function. The approach also identifies uncharacterized stable lncRNAs, hidden among a vast majority of unstable transcripts.

This is partly due to fluctuations in neuromodulatory input from regions such as the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem. LC activity changes with arousal and modulates sensory processing, cognition and memory. The main olfactory bulb (MOB) is richly targeted by LC fibers and noradrenaline profoundly influences MOB circuitry and odor-guided behavior. Noradrenaline-dependent plasticity affects the output of the MOB. However, it is unclear whether noradrenergic plasticity includes modulation in the glomerular layer, the site of input to the MOB. Noradrenergic terminals are found in the glomerular layer, but noradrenaline receptor activation does not seem to acutely modulate olfactory sensory neuron terminals in vitro. We investigated whether noradrenaline induces plasticity at the glomerulus. We used wide-field optical imaging to measure changes in odor responses following electrical stimulation of locus coeruleus in anesthetized mice. Surprisingly, the odor-evoked intrinsic optical signals at the glomerulus were persistently weakened after LC activation. Calcium imaging selectively from olfactory sensory neurons confirmed that this effect was due to a uniform gain suppression of presynaptic input, and did not require exposure to a stimulus during the LC activation. Finally, noradrenaline antagonists prevented glomerular suppression. We conclude that noradrenaline release from LC has persistent effects on odor processing already at the first synapse of the main olfactory system. This mechanism could contribute to arousal-dependent memories.",Stephen David Shea,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

One of the most sophisticated data structures for representing an entire population of genomes is a compressed de Bruijn graph. The graph structure can robustly represent simple SNPs to complex structural variations far beyond what can be done from linear sequences alone. As such there is a strong need to develop algorithms that can efficiently construct and analyze these graphs. Results: In this paper we explore the deep topological relationships between the suffix tree and the compressed de Bruijn graph. We introduce a novel O(n log n) time and space algorithm called splitMEM, that directly constructs the compressed de Bruijn graph for a pan-genome of total length n. To achieve this time complexity, we augment the suffix tree with suffix skips, a new construct that allows us to traverse several suffix links in constant time, and use them to efficiently decompose maximal exact matches (MEMs) into the graph nodes. We demonstrate the utility of splitMEM by analyzing the pan- genomes of 9 strains of Bacillus anthracis and 9 strains of Escherichia coli to reveal the properties of their core genomes.

To determine the genetic basis of energy conservation, we measured the fitness of thousands of pooled mutants of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 during growth in 12 different combinations of electron donors and acceptors. We show that ion pumping by the ferredoxin:NADH oxidoreductase Rnf is required whenever substrate-level phosphorylation is not possible. The uncharacterized complex Hdr/flox-1 (Dde_1207:13) is sometimes important alongside Rnf and may perform an electron bifurcation to generate more reduced ferredoxin from NADH to allow further ion pumping. Similarly, during the oxidation of malate or fumarate, the electron-bifurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB-2 (Dde_1250:1) is important and may generate reduced ferredoxin to allow additional ion pumping by Rnf. During formate oxidation, the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase HysAB is required, which suggests that hydrogen forms in the periplasm, diffuses to the cytoplasm, and is used to reduce ferredoxin, thus providing a substrate for Rnf. During hydrogen utilization, the transmembrane electron transport complex Tmc is important and may move electrons from the periplasm into the cytoplasmic sulfite reduction pathway. Finally, mutants of many other putative electron carriers have no clear phenotype, which suggests that they are not important under our growth conditions.",Morgan  Price,Lawrence Berkeley Lab

Achieving this goal in a statistically meaningful way requires (a) a measure of distinctness of a branch and (b) a test to determine the significance of the observed measure, applicable to all branches and across multiple scales of dissimilarity.\n\nResultsWe formulate a method termed Tree Branches Evaluated Statistically for Tightness (TBEST) for identifying significantly distinct tree branches in hierarchical clusters. For each branch of the tree a measure of distinctness, or tightness, is defined as a rational function of heights, both of the branch and of its parent. A statistical procedure is then developed to determine the significance of the observed values of tightness. We test TBEST as a tool for tree-based data partitioning by applying it to five benchmark datasets, one of them synthetic and the other four each from a different area of biology. For each dataset there is a well-defined partition of the data into classes. In all test cases TBEST performs on par with or better than the existing techniques.\n\nConclusionsBased on our benchmark analysis, TBEST is a tool of choice for detection of significantly distinct branches in hierarchical trees grown from biological data.

Although this transition is ubiquitous, relatively little is known about how the shift from a transcriptionally quiescent to transcriptionally active genome is controlled. We describe here the genome-wide distributions and temporal dynamics of nucleosomes and post-translational histone modifications through the maternal-to-zygotic transition in embryos of the pomace fly Drosophila melanogaster. At mitotic cycle 8, when few zygotic genes are being transcribed, embryonic chromatin is in a relatively simple state: there are few nucleosome free regions, undetectable levels of the histone methylation marks characteristic of mature chromatin, and low levels of histone acetylation at a relatively small number of loci. Histone acetylation increases by cycle 11, but it is not until cycle 13 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread. Early histone acetylation is strongly associated with regions that we have previously shown are bound in early embryos by the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda. Most of these Zelda-bound regions are destined to be enhancers or promoters active during mitotic cycle 14, and our data demonstrate that they are biochemically distinct long before they become active, raising the possibility that Zelda triggers a cascade of events, including the accumulation of specific histone modifications, that plays a role in the subsequent activation of these sequences. Many of these Zelda-associated active regions occur in larger domains that we find strongly enriched for histone marks characteristic of Polycomb-mediated repression, suggesting a dynamic balance between Zelda activation and Polycomb repression. Collectively, these data paint a complex picture of a genome in transition from a quiescent to an active state, and highlight the role of Zelda in mediating this transition.",Michael  Eisen,University of California Berkeley

Recent Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) studies show that enhancers and promoters are embedded in a complex network of looping interactions. Here we use a polymer model of chromatin fiber to investigate whether, and to what extent, looping interactions between elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can influence their contact frequency. Our equilibrium polymer simulations show that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects manifest quite differently for in silico 3C and microscopy. Our results show that looping interactions that do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter pair can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This phenomenon is analogous to allosteric regulation in proteins, where a conformational change triggered by binding of a regulatory molecule to one site affects the state of another site.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn eukaryotes, enhancers directly contact promoters over large genomic distances to regulate gene expression. Characterizing the principles underlying these long-range enhancer-promoter contacts is crucial for a full understanding of gene expression. Recent experimental mapping of chromosomal interactions by the Hi-C method shows an intricate network of local looping interactions surrounding enhancers and promoters. We model a region of chromatin fiber as a long polymer and study how the formation of loops between certain regulatory elements can insulate or facilitate enhancer-promoter interactions. We find 2-5 fold insulation or facilitation, depending on the location of looping elements relative to an enhancer-promoter pair. These effects originate from the polymer nature of chromatin, without requiring additional mechanisms beyond the formation of a chromatin loop. Our findings suggest that loop-mediated gene regulation by elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can be understood as an allosteric effect. This highlights the complex effects that local chromatin organization can have on gene regulation.",Leonid  Mirny,MIT

We have developed the insertional chromatin immunoprecipitatin (iChIP) technology to isolate specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions and identify their associated molecules. iChIP consists of locus-tagging and affinity purification. The recognition sequences of an exogenous DNA-binding protein such as LexA are inserted into a genomic region of interest in the cell to be analyzed. The exogenous DNA-binding protein fused with a tag(s) is expressed in the cell and the target genomic region is purified with antibody against the tag(s). In this study, we developed the iChIP system using recombinant DNA-binding proteins to make iChIP more straightforward.\n\nResultsIn this system, recombinant 3xFNLDD-D (r3xFNLDD-D) consisting of the 3xFLAG-tag, a nuclear localization signal, the DNA-binding domain plus the dimerization domain of the LexA protein, and the Dock-tag is used for isolation of specific genomic regions. 3xFNLDD-D was expressed using a silkworm-baculovirus expression system and purified by affinity purification. iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D could efficiently isolate the single-copy chicken Pax5 (cPax5) locus, in which LexA binding elements were inserted, with negligible contamination of other genomic regions. In addition, we could detect RNA associated with the cPax5 locus using this form of the iChIP system combined with RT-PCR.\n\nConclusionsThe iChIP system using r3xFNLDD-D can isolate specific genomic regions retaining molecular interactions without expression of the exogenous DNA-binding protein in the cell to be analyzed. iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D would be more straightforward and useful for analysis of specific genomic regions to elucidate their functions.",Hodaka  Fujii,"Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University"

It uses an approximation to avoid the need for reversible-jump MCMC, in the form of a prior that is a modification of the birth-death prior for the species tree. It incorporates a spike near zero in the density for node heights. The model has two extra parameters: one controls the degree of approximation, and the second controls the prior distribution on the numbers of species. It is implemented as part of BEAST and requires only a few changes from a standard *BEAST analysis. The method is evaluated on simulated data and demonstrated on an empirical data set.

We also show how change is more pronounced in interactions linking genes in distinct functional modules, and in those connections that present weak epistasis. These patterns reflect overall the distributed robustness of catabolism. In a second class of genetic backgrounds, in which a number of neutral mutations accumulate, we dominantly observe modifications in the negative interactions that together with an increase in the number of essential genes indicate a global reduction in buffering. Notably, neutral trajectories that originate considerable changes in the wild-type network comprise mutations that diminished the environmental plasticity of the corresponding metabolism, what emphasizes a mechanistic integration of genetic and environmental buffering. More generally, our work demonstrates how the specific mechanistic causes of robustness influence the architecture of multiconditional genetic interaction maps.",Juan F Poyatos,Spanish National Biotechnology Centre (CNB-CSIC)

Many studies have used genome-wide data from populations today to learn about the peopling of the globe and subsequent adaptation to local conditions. Implicit in this research is the assumption that the geographic locations of people today are informative about the geographic locations of their ancestors in the distant past. However, it is now clear that long-range migration, admixture and population replacement have been the rule rather than the exception in human history. In light of this, we argue that it is time to critically re-evaluate current views of the peopling of the globe and the importance of natural selection in determining the geographic distribution of phenotypes. We specifically highlight the transformative potential of ancient DNA. By accessing the genetic make-up of populations living at archaeologically-known times and places, ancient DNA makes it possible to directly track migrations and responses to natural selection.",Joseph  Pickrell,New York Genome Center

Since it is possible to associate a broad class of cognitive processes with  dual information sources, many pathologies can be addressed using statistical models based on the Shannon Coding, the Shannon-McMillan Source Coding, the Rate Distortion, and the Data Rate Theorems, as these impose powerful necessary condition constraints on information generation and exchange, and on system control. Deterministic-but-for-error biological codes do not directly invoke cognition, although they may be essential subcomponents within larger cognitive processes. A formal argument, however, places such codes within a similar framework, with metabolic free energy serving as a  control signal stabilizing biochemical code-and-translator dynamics in the presence of noise. Demand beyond available energy supply then expresses itself in punctuated destabilization of the coding channel, affecting a spectrum of essential biological functions. Aging, normal or prematurely driven by psychosocial or environmental stressors, must eventually interfere with the routine operation of such mechanisms, triggering chronic diseases associated with senescence. Amyloid fibril formation, intrinsically disordered protein logic gates, and cell surface glycan/lectin  kelp bed logic gates are reviewed from this perspective. The results, however, generalize beyond coding systems having easily recognizable symmetry modes.",Rodrick  Wallace,New York State Psychiatric Institute

Here, we develop an approximation to the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of segregating single-nucleotide mutations in humans. Unlike previous methods, we do not assume that synonymous mutations are neutral or not strongly selected, and we do not rely on fitting the DFE of all new nonsynonymous mutations to a single probability distribution, which is poorly motivated on a biological level. We rely on a previously developed method that utilizes a variety of published annotations (including conservation scores, protein deleteriousness estimates and regulatory data) to score all mutations in the human genome based on how likely they are to be affected by negative selection, controlling for mutation rate. We map this score to a scale of fitness coefficients via maximum likelihood using diffusion theory and a Poisson random field model on SNP data. Our method serves to approximate the deleterious DFE of mutations that are segregating, regardless of their genomic consequence. We can then compare the proportion of mutations that are negatively selected or neutral across various categories, including different types of regulatory sites. We observe that the distribution of intergenic polymorphisms is highly peaked at neutrality, while the distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms is bimodal, with a neutral peak and a second peak at s {approx} -10-4. Other types of polymorphisms have shapes that fall roughly in between these two. We find that transcriptional start sites, strong CTCF-enriched elements and enhancers are the regulatory categories with the largest proportion of deleterious polymorphisms.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe relative frequencies of polymorphic mutations that are deleterious, nearly neutral and neutral is traditionally called the distribution of fitness effects (DFE). Obtaining an accurate approximation to this distribution in humans can help us understand the nature of disease and the mechanisms by which variation is maintained in the genome. Previous methods to approximate this distribution have relied on fitting the DFE of new mutations to a single probability distribution, like a normal or an exponential distribution. Generally, these methods also assume that a particular category of mutations, like synonymous changes, can be assumed to be neutral or nearly neutral. Here, we provide a novel method designed to reflect the strength of negative selection operating on any segregating site in the human genome. We use a maximum likelihood mapping approach to fit these scores to a scale of neutral and negative fitness coefficients. Finally, we compare the shape of the DFEs we obtain from this mapping for different types of functional categories. We observe the distribution of polymorphisms has a strong peak at neutrality, as well as a second peak of deleterious effects when restricting to nonsynonymous polymorphisms.",Fernando  Racimo,"University of California, Berkeley"

We have performed four analyses, 1) comparing gene expression in infected and non-infected bees 24 hours after infection by Crithidia bombi, 2) comparing expression at 24 and 48 hours after C.bombi infection, 3) searching for differential gene expression associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at 24 hours after infection and 4) searching for alternative splicing associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at 24 hours post infection. We found a large number of genes differentially regulated related to numerous canonical immune pathways. These genes include receptors, signaling pathways and effectors. We discovered a possible interaction between the peritrophic membrane and the insect immune system in defense against Crithidia.

Whereas several genomic studies have revealed some of the genetic bases of adaptations in Tibetan, Andean and Ethiopian populations, relatively little evidence of convergent evolution to altitude in different continents has accumulated. This lack of evidence can be due to truly different evolutionary responses, but it can be also due to the low power of former studies that have mainly focused on populations from a single geographical region or performed separate analyses on multiple pairs of populations to avoid problems linked to shared histories between some populations. We introduce here a hierarchical Bayesian method to detect local adaptation that can deal with complex demographic histories. Our method can identify selection occurring at different scales, as well as convergent adaptation in different regions. We apply our approach to the analysis of a large SNP dataset from low- and high-altitude human populations from America and Asia. The simultaneous analysis of these two geographic areas allows us to identify several candidate genome regions for altitudinal selection, and we show that convergent evolution among continents has been quite common. In addition to identifying several genes and biological processes involved in high altitude adaptation, we identify two specific biological pathways that could have evolved in both continents to counter toxic effects induced by hypoxia.",Matthieu  Foll,École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)

Despite the vast amount of genomic data becoming available, many pressing questions remain about the nature of genetic mutations that underlie functional variation. We present the results of combining genome-wide association analysis of 41 different phenotypes in [~]5,000 inbred maize lines to analyze patterns of high-resolution genetic association among of 28.9 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and [~]800,000 copy-number variants (CNVs). We show that genie and intergenic regions have opposite patterns of enrichment, minor allele frequencies, and effect sizes, implying tradeoffs among the probability that a given polymorphism will have an effect, the detectable size of that effect, and its frequency in the population. We also find that genes tagged by GWAS are enriched for regulatory functions and are [~]50% more likely to have a paralog than expected by chance, indicating that gene regulation and neofunctionalization are strong drivers of phenotypic variation. These results will likely apply to many other organisms, especially ones with large and complex genomes like maize.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe performed genome-wide association mapping analysis in maize for over 40 different phenotypes in order to identify which types of variants are more likely to be important for controlling traits. We took advantage of a large mapping population (roughly 5000 recombinant inbred lines) and nearly 30 million segregating variants to identify [~]4800 variants that were significantly associated with at least one phenotype. While these variants are enriched in genes, most of them occur outside of genes, often in regions where regulatory variants likely lie. We also found a significant enrichment for paralogous (duplicated) genes, implying that functional divergence after gene duplication plays an important role in trait variation. Overall these analyses provide important insight into the unifying patterns of variation in traits across maize, and the results will likely also apply to other organisms with similarly large, complex genomes.",Jason G Wallace,Cornell University

The networks that couple these processes are far from understood. Here, we show that the intestine responds to nutrient availability by regulating production of a circulating lipoprotein associated form of the signaling protein Hedgehog (Hh). Levels of circulating Hh tune the rates of growth and developmental timing in a coordinated fashion. Circulating Hh signals to the fat body to control larval growth. It regulates developmental timing by controlling ecdysteroid production in the prothoracic gland. Circulating Hh is especially important during starvation, when it is also required for mobilization of fat body triacylglycerol (TAG) stores. Thus, we demonstrate that Hh, previously known only for its local morphogenetic functions, also acts as a lipoprotein-associated endocrine hormone, coordinating the response of multiple tissues to nutrient availability.",Suzanne  Eaton,Max-Planck-Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics

We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify such haplotype structures. With HMM identified haplotype structures, a population genetic model for the extent of ancestral haplotypes is then adopted for parameter inference of the selection intensity and the allele age. Simulations show that this method can detect selection under a wide range of conditions and has higher power than the existing frequency spectrum-based method. In addition, it provides good estimate of the selection coefficients and allele ages for strong selection. The method analyzes large data sets in a reasonable amount of running time. This method is applied to HapMap III data for a genome scan, and identifies a list of candidate regions putatively under recent positive selection. It is also applied to several genes known to be under recent positive selection, including the LCT, KITLG and TYRP1 genes in Northern Europeans, and OCA2 in East Asians, to estimate their allele ages and selection coefficients.",Hua  Chen,BIG

However, this hypothesis is based largely on relatively small scale EST-based studies of only venom or salivary glands and toxic effects have been assigned to only some of these putative Toxcoferan toxins in some species. We set out to investigate the distribution of these putative venom toxin transcripts in order to investigate to what extent conservation of gene complements may reflect a bias in previous sampling efforts. Results We have carried out the first large-scale test of the Toxicofera hypothesis and found it lacking in a number of regards. Our quantitative transcriptomic analyses of venom and salivary glands and other body tissues in five species of reptile, together with the use of available RNA-Seq datasets for additional species shows that the majority of genes used to support the establishment and expansion of the Toxicofera are in fact expressed in multiple body tissues and most likely represent general maintenance or housekeeping genes. The apparent conservation of gene complements across the Toxicofera therefore reflects an artefact of incomplete tissue sampling. In other cases, the identification of a non-toxic paralog of a gene encoding a true venom toxin has led to confusion about the phylogenetic distribution of that venom component. Conclusions Venom has evolved multiple times in reptiles. In addition, the misunderstanding regarding what constitutes a toxic venom component, together with the misidentification of genes and the classification of identical or near-identical sequences as distinct genes has led to an overestimation of the complexity of reptile venoms in general, and snake venom in particular, with implications for our understanding of (and development of treatments to counter) the molecules responsible for the physiological consequences of snakebite.",John F Mulley,Bangor University

Genomic studies over the past 5 years have documented differences across populations in the number of heterozygous deleterious genotypes, numbers of homozygous derived deleterious genotypes, number of deleterious segregating sites and proportion of sites that are potentially deleterious. These differences have been attributed to population history affecting the ability of natural selection to remove deleterious variants from the population. However, recent studies have suggested that the genetic load may not differ across populations, and that the efficacy of natural selection has not differed across human populations. Here I show that these observations are not incompatible with each other and that the apparent differences are due to examining different features of the genetic data and differing definitions of terms.",Kirk E Lohmueller,UCLA

To begin addressing this gap, we performed a comparative epigenetic study in primate lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), to query the contribution of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and four histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) to inter-species variation in gene expression levels. We found that inter-species differences in mark enrichment near transcription start sites are significantly more often associated with inter-species differences in the corresponding gene expression level than expected by chance alone.

However, eQTL studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and genome-wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele specific expression (ASE) is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of RNA-seq reads matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In principle, when genotype information is not readily available it could be inferred from the RNA-seq reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls.\n\nResultsWe present QuASAR, Quantitative Allele Specific Analysis of Reads, a novel statistical learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE.

Scott Heller;Martin T Swain;,Genetics ,2014-06-06,2014-12-06,"BackgroundUnderstanding the evolution of the vertebrate pancreas is key to understanding its functions. The chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays) have been suggested to possess the most ancient example of a distinct pancreas with both hormonal (endocrine) and digestive (exocrine) roles, although the lack of genetic, genomic and transcriptomic data for cartilaginous fish has hindered a more thorough understanding of the molecular-level functions of the chondrichthyan pancreas, particularly with respect to their \""unusual\"" energy metabolism (where ketone bodies and amino acids are the main oxidative fuel source) and their paradoxical ability to both maintain stable blood glucose levels and tolerate extensive periods of hypoglycemia. In order to shed light on some of these processes we have carried out the first large-scale comparative transcriptomic survey of multiple cartilaginous fish tissues: the pancreas, brain and liver of the lesser spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula.\n\nResultsWe generated a mutli-tissue assembly comprising 86,006 contigs, of which 44,794 were assigned to a particular tissue or combination of tissue based on mapping of sequencing reads. We have characterised transcripts encoding genes involved in insulin regulation, glucose sensing, transcriptional regulation, signaling and digestion, as well as many peptide hormone precursors and their receptors for the first time. Comparisons to published mammalian pancreas transcriptomes reveals that mechanisms of glucose sensing and insulin regulation used to establish and maintain a stable internal environment are conserved across jawed vertebrates and likely pre-date the vertebrate radiation. Conservation of pancreatic hormones and genes encoding digestive proteins support the single, early evolution of a distinct pancreatic gland with endocrine and exocrine functions in vertebrates, although the peptide diversity of the early vertebrate pancreas has been overestimated as a result of the use of cross-reacting antisera in earlier studies. A three hormone islet organ is therefore the basal vertebrate condition, later elaborated upon only in the tetrapod lineage.\n\nConclusionsThe cartilaginous fish are a great untapped resource for the reconstruction of patterns and processes of vertebrate evolution and new approaches such as those described in this paper will greatly facilitate their incorporation into the rank of \""model organism\"".",John F Mulley,Bangor University

We associated several X-linked genes with disease risk, among which (1) ARHGEF6 is associated with Crohns disease and replicated in a study of ulcerative colitis, another inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Here we apply three Bayesian dating methods that differ in how calibration is achieved-- node dating(ND) in BEAST,  total evidence(TE) dating in MrBayes, and the  fossilised birth-death(FBD) in FDPPDiv--to infer divergence times in the Osmundaceae or royal ferns. Osmundaceae have 13 species in four genera, two mainly in the Northern Hemisphere and two in South Africa and Australasia; they are the sister clade to the remaining leptosporangiate ferns. Their fossil record consists of at least 150 species in [~]17 genera and three extinct families. For ND, we used the five oldest fossils, while for TE and FBD dating, which do not require forcing fossils to nodes and thus can use more fossils, we included up to 36 rhizome and frond compression/impression fossils, which for TE dating were scored for 33 morphological characters. We also subsampled 10%, 25%, and 50% of the 36 fossils to assess model sensitivity. FBD-derived divergence dates were generally greater than ages inferred from ND dating; two of seven TE-derived ages agreed with FBD-obtained ages, the others were much younger or much older than ND or FBD ages. We favour the FBD-derived ages because they best match the Osmundales fossil record (including Triassic fossils not used in our study). Under the preferred model, the clade encompassing extant Osmundaceae (and many fossils) dates to the latest Palaeozoic to Early Triassic; divergences of the extant species occurred during the Neogene. Under the assumption of constant speciation and extinction rates, FBD yielded 0.0299 (0.0099-0.0549) and 0.0240 (0.0039-0.0495) for these rates, whereas neontological data yielded 0.0314 and 0.0339. However, FBD estimates of speciation and extinction are sensitive to violations in the assumption of continuous fossil sampling, therefore these estimates should be treated with caution.#",Guido  Grimm,Swedish Museum of Natural History

We assume that the network is sparse, meaning the connectivity among genes is much less than full connectivity. We develop a method for network reconstruction based on compressive sensing, which takes advantage of the networks sparseness.\n\nResultsFor the case in which all genes are accessible for measurement, and there is no measurement noise, we show that our method can be used to exactly reconstruct the network. For the more general problem, in which hidden genes exist and all measurements are contaminated by noise, we show that our method leads to reliable reconstruction. In both cases, coherence of the model is used to assess the ability to reconstruct the network and to design new experiments. For each problem, a set of numerical examples is presented.\n\nConclusionsThe method provides a guarantee on how well the inferred graph structure represents the underlying system, reveals deficiencies in the data and model, and suggests experimental directions to remedy the deficiencies.",Claire J.

Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.",Timothée  Poisot,Université du Québec à Rimouski

The newfound wealth of rich sources of data--including banknote flows, mobile phone records, and transportation data--have led to an explosion of attempts to characterize modern human mobility. Unfortunately, the dearth of comparable historical data makes it much more difficult to study human mobility patterns from the past. In this paper, we present such an analysis: we demonstrate that the data record from Korean family books (called \""jokbo\"") can be used to estimate migration patterns via marriages from the past 750 years. We apply two generative models of long-term human mobility to quantify the relevance of geographical information to human marriage records in the data, and we find that the wide variety in the geographical distributions of the clans poses interesting challenges for the direct application of these models. Using the different geographical distributions of clans, we quantify the \""ergodicity\"" of clans in terms of how widely and uniformly they have spread across Korea, and we compare these results to those obtained using surname data from the Czech Republic. To examine population flow in more detail, we also construct and examine a population-flow network between regions. Based on the correlation between ergodicity and migration patterns in Korea, we identify two different types of migration patterns: diffusive and convective. We expect the analysis of diffusive versus convective effects in population flows to be widely applicable to the study of mobility and migration patterns across different cultures.",Sang Hoon  Lee,Sungkyunkwan University

Arabidopsis thaliana has colonized a wide range of habitats across the world and it is therefore an attractive model for studying the genetic mechanisms underlying environmental adaptation. Here, we study two collections of A. thaliana accessions from across Eurasia to identify loci associated with differences in climates at the sampling sites. A new genome-wide association analysis method was developed to detect adaptive loci where the alleles tolerate different climate ranges. Sixteen novel such loci were found including a strong association between Chromomethylase 2 (CMT2) and temperature seasonality. The reference allele dominated in areas with less seasonal variability in temperature, and the alternative allele existed in both stable and variable regions. Our results thus link natural variation in CMT2 and epigenetic changes to temperature adaptation. We showed experimentally that plants with a defective CMT2 gene tolerate heat-stress better than plants with a functional gene. Together this strongly suggests a role for genetic regulation of epigenetic modifications in natural adaptation to temperature and illustrates the importance of re-analyses of existing data using new analytical methods to obtain deeper insights into the underlying biology from available data.",Örjan  Carlborg,Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences

While mono-culture assays involve the study of a population of cells composed of a single cell type, co-culture assays study a population of cells composed of multiple cell types (or subpopulations of cells). Such co-culture assays can provide more realistic insights into many biological processes including tissue repair, tissue regeneration and malignant spreading. Typically, system parameters, such as motility and proliferation rates, are estimated by calibrating a mathematical or computational model to the observed experimental data. However, parameter estimates can be highly sensitive to the choice of model and modelling framework. This observation motivates us to consider the fundamental question of how we can best choose a model to facilitate accurate parameter estimation for a particular assay. In this work we describe three mathematical models of mono-culture and co-culture assays that include different levels of spatial detail. We study various spatial summary statistics to explore if they can be used to distinguish between the suitability of each model over a range of parameter space. Our results for mono-culture experiments are promising, in that we suggest two spatial statistics that can be used to direct model choice. However, co-culture experiments are far more challenging: we show that these same spatial statistics which provide useful insight into mono-culture systems are insufficient for co-culture systems.

Here I theoretically study the evolution of social-cognitive competencies as driven by selection emerging from the need to produce public goods in games against nature or in direct competition with other groups. I use collaborative ability in collective actions as a proxy for social-cognitive competencies. My results suggest that collaborative ability is more likely to evolve first by between-group conflicts and then later be utilized and improved in games against nature. If collaborative abilities remain low, the species is predicted to become genetically dimorphic with a small proportion of individuals contributing to public goods and the rest free-riding.

We infer that the ancestors of western and eastern lowland gorillas diverged from a common ancestor [~]261 thousand years ago (kya), and that the ancestors of the Cross River population diverged from the western lowland gorilla lineage [~]68 kya. Using a diffusion approximation approach to model the genome-wide site frequency spectrum, we infer a history of western lowland gorillas that includes an ancestral population expansion of [~]1.4-fold around [~]970 kya and a recent [~]5.6-fold contraction in population size [~]23 kya.

While feedforward influences convey sensory signals, feedback influences modulate brain responses to a given sensory stimulus according to the current behavioural context. Many studies have demonstrated effects of feedback influences on feedforward driven responses and on behaviour. Also, anatomical projections in both directions have been identified. However, although these studies have revealed the anatomical paths and the neurophysiological consequences of influences in both directions, the neurophysiological mechanisms through which these influences are exerted remain largely elusive. Here we show that in the primate visual system, feedforward influences are carried by theta-band (~4 Hz) and gamma-band (~60-80 Hz) synchronization, and feedback influences by beta-band (~14-18 Hz) synchronization. These frequency-specific asymmetries in directed influences were revealed by simultaneous local field potential recordings from eight visual areas and an analysis of Granger-causal influences across all 28 pairs of areas. The asymmetries in directed influences correlated directly with asymmetries in anatomy and enabled us to build a visual cortical hierarchy from the influence asymmetries alone. Across different task periods, most areas stayed at their hierarchical position, whereas particularly frontal areas moved dynamically. Our results demonstrate that feedforward and feedback signalling use different frequency channels, which might subserve their differential communication requirements and lead to differential local consequences.

The New World warblers (Parulidae) and Old World warblers (Phylloscopidae) are ecologically similar clades that differ strikingly in plumage coloration. We studied genetic and functional evolution of the short-wavelength sensitive visual pigments (SWS2 and SWS1) to ask if altered color perception could contribute to the plumage color differences between clades. We show SWS2 is short-wavelength shifted in birds that occupy open environments, such as finches, compared to those in closed environments, including warblers. Sequencing of opsin genes and phylogenetic reconstructions indicate New World warblers were derived from a finch-like form that colonized from the Old World 15-20Ma. During this process the SWS2 gene accumulated 6 substitutions in branches leading to New World warblers, inviting the hypothesis that passage through a finch-like ancestor resulted in SWS2 evolution. In fact, we show spectral tuning remained similar across warblers as well as the finch ancestor. Results reject the hypothesis of historical contingency based on opsin spectral tuning, but point to evolution of other aspects of visual pigment function. Using the approach outlined here, historical contingency becomes a generally testable theory in systems where genotype and phenotype can be connected.",Natasha  Bloch,University of Chicago

Inoculated with natural communities, they present a complex microbial ecosystem with syntrophic interactions between microbes with different metabolic capabilities. From this point of view, they are similar to anaerobic digesters, however with methanogenesis replaced by anaerobic respiration with the anode as terminal electron acceptor. Bio-electrochemically they are similar to classical fuel cells where however the electrogenic redox reaction is part of the microbial metabolism rather than mediated by an inorganic catalyst.\n\nIn this paper, we analyse how electric power production in MFCs depends on the composition of the anodic biofilm in terms of metabolic capabilities of identified sets of species. MFCs were started with a natural inoculum and continuously fed with sucrose, a fermentable carbohydrate. The composition of the community, power and other environmental data were sampled over a period of a few weeks during the maturation of the anodic biofilm, and the community composition was determined down to the species level including relevant metabolic capabilities.\n\nOur results support the hypothesis that an MFCs with natural inoculum and fermentable feedstock is essentially a two stage system with fermentation followed by anode-respiration. Our results also show that under identical starting and operating conditions, MFCs with comparable power output can develop different anodic communities with no particular species dominant across all replicas.

Data collected were compared to prior natural history data in regard to age at diagnosis, mutation spectrum, and age at loss of ambulation. Because registrants reported differences in steroid and other medication usage, as well as age and ambulation status, we could explore these data for correlations with age at loss of ambulation. Using multivariate analysis, current steroid usage was the most significant and largest independent predictor of improved wheelchair-free survival. Thus, these online self-report data were sufficient to retrospectively observe that current steroid use by patients with DMD is associated with a delay in loss of ambulation. Comparing commonly used steroid drugs, deflazacort prolonged ambulation longer than prednisone (median 14 years and 13 years, respectively). Further, use of Vitamin D and Coenzyme Q10, insurance status, and age at diagnosis after 4 years were also significant, but smaller, independent predictors of longer wheelchair-free survival. Nine other common supplements were also individually tested but had lower study power. This study demonstrates the utility of DuchenneConnect data to observe therapeutic differences, and highlights needs for improvement in quality and quantity of patient-report data, which may allow exploration of drug/therapeutic practice combinations impractical to study in clinical trial settings.

First, their firing is spatially selective1-3, termed a rate code. Second, as animals traverse through place fields, neurons sustain elevated firing rates for long periods, however this has received little attention. Third the theta-phase of spikes within this sustained activity varies with animals location, termed phase-precession or a temporal code4-10. The precise relationship between these properties and the mechanisms governing them are not understood, although distal visual cues (DVC) are thought to be sufficient to reliably elicit them2,3. Hence, we measured rat CA1 neurons activity during random foraging in two-dimensional VR--where only DVC provide consistent allocentric location information-- and compared it with their activity in real world (RW). Surprisingly, we found little spatial selectivity in VR. This is in sharp contrast to robust spatial selectivity commonly seen in one-dimensional RW and VR7-11, or two-dimensional RW1-3. Despite this, neurons in VR generated approximately two-second long phase precessing spike sequences, termed \""hippocampal motifs\"". Motifs, and \""Motif-fields\"", an aggregation of all motifs of a neuron, had qualitatively similar properties including theta-scale temporal coding in RW and VR, but the motifs were far less spatially localized in VR. These results suggest that intrinsic, network mechanisms generate temporally coded hippocampal motifs, which can be dissociated from their spatial selectivity. Further, DVC alone are insufficient to localize motifs spatially to generate a robust rate code.",Mayank  Mehta,UCLA

Their presence produces intense Fisherian selection to return the sex ratio to parity, typified by the rapid spread of host  suppressor loci that restore male survival/development. In this study, we investigated the genomic impact of a selective event of this kind in the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina. Through linkage mapping we first identified a genomic region that was necessary for males to survive Wolbachia-induced killing. We then investigated the genomic impact of the rapid spread of suppression that converted the Samoan population of this butterfly from a 100:1 female-biased sex ratio in 2001, to a 1:1 sex ratio by 2006. Models of this process revealed the potential for a chromosome-wide selective sweep. To measure the impact directly, the pattern of genetic variation before and after the episode of selection was compared. Significant changes in allele frequencies were observed over a 25cM region surrounding the suppressor locus, alongside generation of linkage disequilibrium. The presence of novel allelic variants in 2006 suggests that the suppressor was introduced via immigration rather than through de novo mutation. In addition, further sampling in 2010 indicated that many of the introduced variants were lost or had reduced in frequency since 2006. We hypothesise that this loss may have resulted from a period of purifying selection - removing deleterious material that introgressed during the initial sweep. Our observations of the impact of suppression of sex ratio distorting activity reveal an extraordinarily wide genomic imprint, reflecting its status as one of the strongest selective forces in nature.",Emily A Hornett,University of Cambridge

However, natural selection working in large wild populations can shift allele frequencies and indicate functional regions of the genome. Previously, we showed that the two most common alleles of a complex amino acid insertion-deletion polymorphism in the Drosophila insulin receptor show independent, parallel clines in frequency across the North American and Australian continents. Here, we report that the cline is stable over at least a five-year period and that the polymorphism also demonstrates temporal shifts in allele frequency concurrent with seasonal change. We tested the alleles for effects on levels of insulin signaling, fecundity, development time, body size, stress tolerance, and lifespan. We find that the alleles are associated with predictable differences in these traits, consistent with patterns of Drosophila life history variation across geography that likely reflect adaptation to the heterogeneous climatic environment. These results implicate insulin signaling as a major mediator of life history adaptation in Drosophila, and suggest that life history tradeoffs can be explained by extensive pleiotropy at a single locus.",Annalise B.

We focus on universal evolutionary characteristics: these are largely independent of a traits genetic basis, which is often at least partially unknown. We show that universal measurements can be used to infer selection on a quantitative trait, which determines its evolutionary mode of conservation or adaptation. Furthermore, universality is closely linked to predictability of trait evolution across lineages.

We use FBA to calculate bacterial phenotypes from growth conditions in E. coli, and then we assess how accurately we can predict the original growth conditions from the phenotypes. Prediction is carried out via regularized multinomial regression. Our analysis provides several important physiological and statistical insights. First, we show that by analyzing metabolic end products we can consistently predict growth conditions. Second, prediction is reliable even in the presence of small amounts of impurities. Third, flux through a relatively small number of reactions per growth source (~10) is sufficient for accurate prediction. Fourth, combining the predictions from two separate models, one trained only on carbon sources and one only on nitrogen sources, performs better than models trained to perform joint prediction. Finally, that separate predictions perform better than a more sophisticated joint prediction scheme suggests that carbon and nitrogen utilization pathways, despite jointly affecting cellular growth, may be fairly decoupled in terms of their dependence on specific assortments of molecular precursors.",Claus O Wilke,The University of Texas at Austin

However, sometimes less hydrophobic helices are also recognized. Positive inside rule, orientational preferences of and specific interactions with neighboring helices have been shown to aid in the recognition of these helices, at least in artificial systems. To better understand how the translocon inserts marginally hydrophobic helices, we studied three naturally occurring marginally hydrophobic helices, which were previously shown to require the subsequent helix for efficient translocon recognition. We find no evidence for specific interactions when we scan all residues in the subsequent helices. Instead, we identify arginines located at the N-terminal part of the subsequent helices that are crucial for the recognition of the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices, indicating that the positive inside rule is important. However, in two of the constructs these arginines do not aid in the recognition without the rest of the subsequent helix, i.e. the positive inside rule alone is not sufficient. Instead, the improved recognition of marginally hydrophobic helices can here be explained as follows; the positive inside rule provides an orientational preference of the subsequent helix, which in turn allows the marginally hydrophobic helix to be inserted, i.e. the effect of the positive inside rule is stronger if positively charged residues are followed by a transmembrane helix. Such a mechanism can obviously not aid C-terminal helices and consequently we find that the terminal helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than internal helices.",Arne  Elofsson,Stockholm University

However, strong conclusions on the admissible dynamic behaviors of a model can often be achieved without detailed knowledge of its specific parameters. In particular, starting with Thomas' conjectures, loop-based criteria have been largely used to characterize oscillatory and multistationary dynamic outcomes in systems with a sign definite Jacobian.\n\nWe build on the rich literature focused on the identification of potential oscillatory and multistationary behaviors based on parameter-free criteria. We propose a classification for sign-definite non autocatalytic biological networks which summarize several existing results in the literature, adding new results when necessary. We define candidate oscillators and multistationary systems based on their admissible transitions to instability. We introduce four categories: strong/weak candidate oscillatory/multistationary systems, which correspond to networks in which all/some of the existing feedback loops are negative/positive. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing strong and weak candidate oscillators and multistationary systems based on the exclusive or simultaneous presence of positive and negative loops in their linearized dynamics. We also consider the case in which the overall system is the connection of several stable aggregate monotone components, providing conditions in terms of positive/negative loops in a suitable network with aggregate monotone systems as nodes.\n\nMost realistic examples of biological networks fall in the gray area of systems in which both positive and negative cycles are present: therefore, both oscillatory and bistable behavior are in principle possible. Native systems with a large number of components are often interconnections of monotone modules, where negative/positive loops among modules characterize oscillatory and bistable behaviors, in agreement with our results. Finally, we note that many canonical example circuits exhibiting oscillations or bistability fall in the categories of strong candidate oscillators/multistationary systems.",Elisa  Franco,University of California at Riverside

We find that expression of protease-dead separase is dominant-negative in C. elegans embryos. The C. elegans embryo is an ideal system to study developmental processes in a genetically tractable system. However, a major limitation is the lack of an inducible gene expression system for the embryo. The most common method for embryonic expression involves generation of integrated transgenes under the control of the pie-1 promoter, using unc-119 as a selection marker. However expression of dominant-negative proteins kills the strain preventing analysis of mutants. We have developed two methods that allow for the propagation of lines carrying dominant-negative transgenes in order to study protease-dead separase in embryos. The first involves feeding gfp RNAi to eliminate transgene expression and allows propagation of transgenic lines indefinitely. Animals removed from gfp RNAi for several generations recover transgene expression and associated phenotypes. The second involves propagation of the transgene with the female specific pie-1 promoter via the male germline and analysis of phenotypes in embryos from F1 heterozygous hermaphrodites that express the protein. Using these methods, we show that protease-dead separase causes chromosome nondisjunction and cytokinesis failures. These methods are immediately applicable for studies of dominant-negative transgenes and should open new lines of investigation in the C. elegans embryo.",Joshua  Bembenek,UT Knoxville

In reptiles, two main evolutionary lines emerged, one gave rise to Squamata, while the other gave rise to Testudines, Crocodylia and birds. In this study, we determined the genomic variable (V)-gene repertoire in reptiles corresponding to the three main immunoglobulin (Ig) loci and the four main T-cell receptor (TCR) loci. We show that squamata lack the TCR{gamma} /{delta} genes and snakes lack the V{kappa} genes. In representative species of testudines and crocodiles, the seven major Ig and TCR loci are maintained. As in mammals, genes of the Ig loci can be grouped into well-defined clans through a multi-species phylogenetic analysis. We show that the reptile VH and V{lambda} genes are distributed amongst the established mammalian clans, while their V{kappa} genes are found within a single clan, nearly exclusive from the mammalian sequences. The reptile and mammal V-genes of the TRA locus cluster into six common evolutionary clans. In contrast, the reptile V-genes from the TRB locus cluster into three clans, which have few mammalian members. In this locus, the V-gene sequences from mammals appear to have undergone different evolutionary diversification processes that occurred outside these shared reptile clans.",David N Olivieri,Universidad de Vigo; School of Computer Science (Spain)

In practice, however, a frequent assumption in behavioral science is that most of an animals activities can be described in terms of a small set of stereotyped motifs. Here we introduce a method for mapping the behavioral space of organisms, relying only upon the underlying structure of postural movement data to organize and classify behaviors. We find that six different drosophilid species each perform a mix of non-stereotyped actions and over one hundred hierarchically-organized, stereotyped behaviors.

Here we described the distribution of Progestin-induced chromatin modifications and changes in transcriptional activity over TADs in T47D breast cancer cells. Using ChIP-Seq, Hi-C and 3D modelling techniques, we found that the borders of the [~]2,000 TADs in these cells are largely maintained after hormone treatment but that some TADs operate as discrete regulatory units in which the majority of the genes are either transcriptionally activated or repressed upon hormone stimulus. The epigenetic signatures of the TADs are coordinately modified by hormone in correlation with the transcriptional changes. Hormone-induced changes in gene activity and chromatin remodeling are accompanied by differential structural changes for activated and repressed TADs. In response to hormone activated TADs exhibit higher density of internal contacts, while repressed TADs show less intra-TAD contacts. Integrative 3D modelling revealed that TADs structurally expanded if activated and compacted when repressed, and that this is accompanied by differential changes in their global accessibility. We thus propose that TADs function as \""regulons\"" to enable spatially proximal genes to be coordinately transcribed in response to hormones.",Miguel  Beato,Centre de Regulaci? Gen?mica (CRG)

Maintaining a disease-free nest environment is an important evolutionary feature, but since workers have to leave the nest to forage they are routinely exposed to disease. Here we show that despite effective social immunity, in which workers act collectively to reduce disease inside the nest, 100% of studied ant colonies of Camponotus rufipes in a Brazilian Rainforest were infected by the specialized fungal parasite Ophiocordyceps unilateralis s.l. Not only is disease present for all colonies but long-term dynamics over 20 months revealed disease is a permanent feature. Using 3D maps, we showed the parasite optimizes its transmission by controlling workers behavior to die on the doorstep of the colony, where susceptible foragers are predictable in time and space.

Currently, when the genomes of different strains of a given organism are compared, whole genome resequencing data are aligned to an established reference sequence. However when the reference differs in significant structural ways from the individuals under study, the analysis is often incomplete or inaccurate. Here, we use rice as a model to explore the extent of structural variation among strains adapted to different ecologies and geographies, and show that this variation can be significant, often matching or exceeding the variation present in closely related human populations or other mammals. We demonstrate how improvements in sequencing and assembly technology allow rapid and inexpensive de novo assembly of next generation sequence data into high-quality assemblies that can be directly compared to provide an unbiased assessment. Using this approach, we are able to accurately assess the \""pan-genome\"" of three divergent rice varieties and document several megabases of each genome absent in the other two. Many of the genome-specific loci are annotated to contain genes, reflecting the potential for new biological properties that would be missed by standard resequencing approaches. We further provide a detailed analysis of several loci associated with agriculturally important traits, illustrating the utility of our approach for biological discovery.

On one hand, stretches of constant selection pull the genetic makeup of populations towards local fitness optima. On the other, in order to cope with changes in the selection regime, populations may evolve mechanisms that create a diversity of genotypes. By tuning the rates at which variability is produced, such as the rates of recombination, mutation or migration, populations may increase their long-term adaptability. Here we use theoretical models to gain insight into how the rates of these three evolutionary forces are shaped by fluctuating selection. We compare and contrast the evolution of recombination, mutation and migration under similar patterns of environmental change and show that these three sources of phenotypic variation are surprisingly similar in their response to changing selection. We show that knowing the shape, size, variance and asymmetry of environmental runs is essential for accurate prediction of genetic evolutionary dynamics.",Oana  Carja,Stanford University

Here we tested how well motor commands are generated in the absence of kinaesthetic feedback by decoding hand movements from human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in three conditions: unimpaired movement, imagined movement, and movement attempted during temporary disconnection of peripheral afferent and efferent nerves by ischemic nerve block.

The widespread use of clonal planting material, however, aids the spread of disease. Breeding for disease resistance and improved yield began in the 1920s and has accelerated in the last 45 years. To assist in the rapid identification of markers for pathogen resistance and crop traits, and to accelerate breeding programs, we generated a framework map for M. esculenta Crantz derived from reduced representation sequencing (genotyping-by-sequencing [GBS]). The composite 2,412 cM map integrates ten biparental maps (comprising 3,480 meioses) and organizes 22,403 genetic markers on 18 chromosomes, in agreement with the observed karyotype.

Using standard genetic analyses, we tracked the preference difference to the lack of functional mitochondria the stock of BY4742 used in the initial experiment. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy to examine the volatile compounds produced by BY4741 and the mitochondria-deficient BY4742, and found they differed significantly. We found that several ethyl esters are present at much higher levels in strains with functional mitochondria, even in fermentative conditions. We confirmed the role of these ethyl esters in attraction by examining an EEB1{Delta} strain which reduces ethyl ester production. We found that nitrogen levels in the substrate affect the production of these compounds, and that they are produced at high levels by strains with functional mitochondria in the fermentation of natural substrates.

The increasing number of medical institutions and medical students attracts the challenge of inadequate facilitation of the teaching and learning processes. This warrants a study and/or an exploration of an alternative solution such as wooden models in order to solve the problem of scarce and ethically restricted human teaching aids.

Wooden pieces (50cm length x 20cm diameter) from a Jacaranda mimosifolia tree were prepared for the carving process and wooden replicas of human skulls were made. Two experimental groups of randomly selected medical students (60: Active and 60: Control) were separately taught using wooden and natural skull models respectively. The two groups were assessed and evaluated using the natural skull models to compare their understanding of the Anatomy of the skull. Additionally, opinion statements were collected from participants in the active group during the oral examination.

Six (6) wooden skull models were produced and used for experimental study. Comparisons of academic scores (mean and median) between Active (students using the wooden skull) and control (students using natural skull) groups showed no statistical significant difference (P [&ge;] 0.05). Concerning the enhancement of learning skills; the wooden model was constructed in a way that would be able to enhance learning as it would be the natural skull.
